\section{Model}

The model extends \cite{Bilbiie2012EndogenousCycles} and abstracts from shocks. 
I introduce
\begin{itemize}
\item household heterogeneity in income through skills and investment
\item satiated consumption \ar look up whether this can be solved by a shooting algorithm (what we did in Keith's topics class/ things I collected for first paper)
\item 2 production sectors with sustainable and unsustainable quality
\end{itemize}

But they only have innovation as an increase in product variety not an increase in productivity of a given sector.

to keep:
\begin{itemize}
\item monpolistic competition
\end{itemize}
