\section{Model}

3 model blocks: households, producing firms, innovation sector.

\paragraph{Production}
2 intermediate good's sectors: a sustainable and an unsustainable one. In each sector there is a unit mass of monopolistically competitive firms. 
Each sector sells a final good which are aggregated by competitive and sector-specific final good producers according to
\begin{align}
	Y_n= \left(\int_{0}^{1} y_n(j)^{\frac{\varepsilon_n-1}{\varepsilon_n}}dj\right)^{\frac{\varepsilon_n}{\varepsilon_n-1}} \\
	Y_s= \left(\int_{0}^{1} y_s(j)^{\frac{\varepsilon_s-1}{\varepsilon_s}}dj\right)^{\frac{\varepsilon_s}{\varepsilon_s-1}} \\
\end{align}
Is the competition of firms within or across sectors?


The model extends \cite{Bilbiie2012EndogenousCycles} and abstracts from shocks. 
I introduce
\begin{itemize}
\item household heterogeneity in income through skills and investment
\item satiated consumption \ar look up whether this can be solved by a shooting algorithm (what we did in Keith's topics class/ things I collected for first paper)
\item 2 production sectors with sustainable and unsustainable quality
\end{itemize}

But they only have innovation as an increase in product variety not an increase in productivity of a given sector.

to keep:
\begin{itemize}
\item monpolistic competition
\end{itemize}
