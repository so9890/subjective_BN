and some scholars have pointed to limiting consumption to handle environmental boundaries.\footnote{\ \cite{Schor2005SustainableReductionb} argues for the necessity to limit consumption in the global North through a reduction in working time. \cite{Arrow2004AreMuch} raise the question if today's consumption is too high from a sustainability perspective. \cite{Dasgupta2021}  argues for the impossibility of indefinite growth due to planetary boundaries  \citep{Rockstrom2009AHumanity}. %: acknowledging planetary boundaries, i.e., boundaries which define a state of nature in which humans can safely exist \citep{Rockstrom2009AHumanity}, and that production and consumption produce waste, infinite production would degrade nature in a way that production is impossible.

	. } A reduction in work effort and consumption mitigates pollution by diminishing economic activity. Distortionary fiscal policies qualify as a reductive policy instrument to target the level of production.
However, the literature on environmental policy has focused on compositional policies: environmental taxes. %\citep{Fried2018ClimateAnalysis}. 
Given the exigency to act, this paper addresses the question whether fiscal policies can help meet climate targets. %Using analytical and quantitative methods, I show that reductive policies form part of the optimal environmental policy even absent an additional target.


%This is your core argument for why reductive policy measures may work, so you should mention above that you consider this possibility,  MACHE ICH DAS NICHT MIT DER rESEARCH QUESTION? suggested by its proponents (your "scholars" :-)), and actually show that it works.

In the first part of the paper, I show analytically that once 
labor supply is elastic, reductive policy measures optimally complement the environmental tax. 
The literature has established that, absent any other distortion, an environmental tax equal to the social cost of the externality implements the efficient allocation. 
%Environmental taxes are perceived as a cost-effective way to reduce emissions. 
I demonstrate that this result crucially depends on the use of lump-sum transfers to redistribute environmental tax revenues. Transfers reduce labor supply through an income effect. %Thus, indeed there is a role for reductive policy measures. 
%\textcolor{blue}{This is interesting independent of whether they are feasible or not. Could relate to the fact that there is a discussion how to use revenues. Yet, one might argue that we are always in a setting with distortionary labor income taxes; so that recycling lump-sum is never needed; numbers on size of expected revenues and government spending}
When environmental tax revenues are not redistributed lump sum, environmental taxes are optimally combined with progressive labor income taxes. The use of income taxes as a reductive policy measure is not directly targeted at the externality: the motive for labor taxation emerges from a distortion in labor markets as households feel poorer than the economy is.\footnote{\ This is a novel motive for the use of reductive policies adding to the arguments made in the literature listed in the previous footnote. These are: conflicts with other goals such as the UN sustainability goals, risks associated with carbon capture and storage technology, and planetary boundaries and limits to growth.} %Hence,  % to lower inefficiently high hours worked. 
% I show that redistributing environmental tax revenues through an income tax scheme allows to implement the efficient allocation. The optimal income tax scheme is progressive.

In the second part, I scrutinize whether progressive income taxes remain optimal in an endogenous growth model with heterogeneous skills. The government cannot use lump-sum transfers but consumes environmental tax revenues.
 %In the spirit of \cite{Acemoglu2002DirectedChange}, directed technical change may intensify or mitigate these channels thr recomposition. %Second, an overall reduction in labor supply curbing production may lower general research incentives.

 The model suggests that the optimal income tax scheme is progressive. The benefits of labor taxation emerge from (i) more leisure and (ii) gains from knowledge spillovers.
 The latter advantage arises as a fossil tax directs research from the non-energy sector to the energy sector.  Energy and non-energy goods are complements in final good production. The literature on directed technical change has shown that when goods are sufficiently complementary a price effect dominates the direction of research \citep{Acemoglu2002DirectedChange, Acemoglu2012TheChange, Hemous2021DirectedEconomics}. Therefore, as the fossil tax makes energy more expensive, the higher price of energy goods pulls research to the energy sector.
 This effect of the environmental tax counters the intention to lower emissions and decreases knowledge spillovers from the non-energy sector. Knowledge spillovers from the non-energy sector, however, are especially valuable, as it is the biggest sector in terms of research processes.

% On the one hand, a skill bias documented for the green sector \citep{Consoli2016DoCapital} in combination with a relatively more elastic high-skill labor supply causes a higher tax progressivity to recompose the economic structure towards dirty production. On the other hand, a higher labor share in the fossil sector implies a recomposition of the economy towards green production.

% relation to literature
I discuss briefly the most important contributions of the paper.
First, the results are relevant for the political and academic debate on how  to recycle environmental tax revenues. The paper points to the importance of lump-sum transfers within the optimal environmental policy as a reductive policy tool; an aspect which appears overlooked in the discussion.%\footnote{\ POLICY debate; \cite{Fried2018TheGenerations}}
When thinking about how to recycle environmental tax revenues other than by lump-sum transfers,  one should take into account alternative reductive tools such as progressive labor income taxes. 
If the reductive part of the environmental policy is neglected, environmental taxes have to be higher to meet emission limits, as I demonstrate in the quantitative exercise.

Second, the results contribute to the academic debate on the so-called \textit{weak double dividend} \citep[for example:][]{LansBovenberg1994EnvironmentalTaxation, LansBovenberg1996OptimalAnalyses}. The hypothesis posits that recycling environmental tax revenues to reduce preexisting tax distortions is advantageous to recycling  revenues as lump-sum transfers. The rationale is that transfers decrease labor supply thereby diminishing the tax base of the income tax. %A conflict between generating government funds and environmental protection arises. 
The findings in the present paper suggest a lower bound on the reduction in distortionary income taxes: when environmental tax revenues are not redistributed lump sum, some reduction in labor supply via distortionary income taxes is in fact efficient from an environmental policy perspective. %In other words, even if environmental tax revenues suffice to satisfy a government revenue requirement, there is a motive for progressive income taxation. 

Third, the findings are especially interesting as the provision of the environmental public good and equity have been perceived as competing targets in the literature. When the poor consume more of the polluting good, a corrective tax is regressive \citep{ Fried2018TheGenerations, Sager2019IncomeCurves}. % \textit{Metcalf 2007, Hassett 2009 as  in Fried 2018}. 
%Second and more indirectly, a fossil tax exerts efficiency costs by lowering labor efforts\footnote{\ The reduction in hours worked is per se not inefficient. The reduction in dirty production reduces the marginal product of labor, which might make a reduction efficient. However, when the government seeks to tax labor income using distortionary policy tools, the reduced labor supply diminishes the tax base of the labor tax making it more costly to redistribute.} which again raises the cost for the government to redistribute \citep{Dobkowitz2022}. 
In contrast to this literature, the present paper provides an argument for progressive income taxes under perfect income-risk sharing suggesting a double dividend of redistribution: equity and efficient externality mitigation. %: equity on the one hand and efficiency gains from less labor as part of the environmental policy.
