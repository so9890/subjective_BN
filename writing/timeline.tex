In a year \ar \textbf{October 2022}\\ need to have sth to argue for an extension of PhD phase! 
\ar \textbf{some interesting results in a simple model on which to build on }
\\

Goal for \textbf{February 2022 }before going to Paris
\begin{itemize}
\item have results from data \ar 1) need to know who consumes how much in terms of resources/ emissions... 2) and if there are insights on a deliberate reduction in consumption ... 3) the consumption of sustainable versus non-sustainable goods
\item GET MODEL IN WHICH TO STUDY POLICIES; KEY ELEMENTS
\begin{itemize}
\item green and non-green sector
\item inequality: high and low skill workers; only rich own capital or firm dividends
\item sticky prices
\item endogenous innovation 
\item consumption has an upper bound \ar policy measure or intrinsically changed\\
\item does utility also feature basic needs? \ar interesting for trade-offs! Have to look at data
\end{itemize}
