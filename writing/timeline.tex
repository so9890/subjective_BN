\begin{itemize}

\item have results from data \ar 1) need to know who consumes how much in terms of resources/ emissions... 2) and if there are insights on a deliberate reduction in consumption ... 3) the consumption of sustainable versus non-sustainable goods
\item define MODEL IN WHICH TO STUDY POLICIES; KEY ELEMENTS
\begin{itemize}
\item green and non-green sector
\item inequality: high and low skill workers; only rich own capital or firm dividends
%\item sticky prices
\item endogenous directed innovation 
\item consumption has an upper bound \ar policy measure or intrinsically changed
