\section{Guideline Computations}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item calibrate initial situation to data, using observed tax rates (this would be a competitive equilibrium with taxes as given)
	\item find BGP; BGP exists when $c^*_s+c_n^*\geq \bar{c}$; that is optimal allocation without penalty satisfies basic needs; from this point onwards there are no reallocations across sectors and sectors grow at a constant rate, this is equivalent to the solution of the problem without penalty term \ar \textbf{Need to solve Ramsey problem for BGP absent penalty term}
	Could also solve for the BGP in Ramsey model numerically: get model equations and set growth corrected variables to constant values\\
	Follow \cite{Jones1993OptimalGrowth}:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item fix assumed SS tax rates and transfers relative to output
		\item calculate ss values of consumption/output, other variables relative to output (constant in ss)
		\item make end corrections to Ramsey problem which is explicitly solved up to period T given the values from point 1 and 2 above
		\item iterate until guess in 1 matches with solution for ss value 
	\end{enumerate}
end corrections are derived analytically.
	\item for competitive equilibrium follow \cite{Acemoglu2008CapitalGrowth}: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item analytically or numerically calculate BGP values
		\item initial values and parameters match to data (including tax rates and transfers)
		\item use shooting (or relaxation) algorithm to find solution, i.e. sequence of allocations that solve two boundary value problem: shooting algorithm finds initial conditions that s.t. ss values are matched. 
		\item proof uniqueness of transition path? 
	\end{enumerate}
	
	they write \begin{quote}
		The previous subsection demonstrated that there exists a unique CGP with  nonbalanced  sectoral  growth;  that  is,  there  is  aggregate  output growth at a constant rate together with differential sectoral growth and reallocation of factors of production across sectors. We now investigate whether the competitive equilibrium will approach the CGP. 
	\end{quote} 
\ar From where my economy starts today with calibrated ws, and taxes (a constant growth path), does it converge to a new constant growth path where ws is higher? 
\item in my model growth rates of sectoral consumption are not constant over time! Households reallocate shares as they get richer
\end{enumerate}

Simple version without growth
\begin{enumerate}
	\item economy is in SS today, as households income does not change their consumption is fixed, period t=0
	\item then in period t=1 ws rises (1)\ar what is the optimal policy when ws rises starting from calibrated tax rates; (2)\ar what is the new ss and how does the economy converge?
	\item[\ar] I know initial and end conditions, the shock system is also known a priori, then use shooting or relaxation algorithm to calculate transition
\end{enumerate}
