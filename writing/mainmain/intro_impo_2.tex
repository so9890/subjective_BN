\begin{comment}
When labor supply is fixed, environmental taxes alone can establish the efficient allocation in a representative agent economy absent fiscal distortions. Then, such a tax instrument is optimally set to the social cost of an externality, and originators internalize these social costs: the Pigou principle.
However, not redistributing environmental tax revenues reduces consumption below the efficient level and, as I demonstrate, the optimal environmental tax does not follow the Pigou principle.  If, on top, the  labor supply decision is endogenous, the environmental tax alone features too high labor supply. \tr{This results in too high environmental externality. \textbf{To be shown!}}

Lump-sum transfers of environmental tax revenues restore the efficient allocation: as households become richer, labor supply reduces. When lump-sum transfers are not available, the government can establish the efficient allocation by redistributing environmental tax revenues through an income tax scheme which I demonstrate to be progressive.

%\subsubsection*{First part: Analytic stuff}
%\paragraph{simple model}
To derive the theoretical results, I propose a simple and general model. There are two intermediate sectors of production, one of which exerts a negative environmental externality. The environmental externality is the only distortion motivating government action. In the model, a Ramsey planner seeks to maximize welfare of a representative agent having  an environmental and a labor income tax at her disposal. The income tax scheme is generally non-linear and a common specification in the public finance literature \citep[e.g.][]{Benabou2002TaxEfficiency, Heathcote2017OptimalFramework}.
The model abstracts from  endogenous growth, inequality, and an exogenous government funding constraint. The last two are important abstractions since they traditionally motivate income taxation.

%\paragraph{Analytic findings 1}
%\textbf{MAIN finding: Progressive income tax} 
I show that the optimal labor income tax is progressive when no lump-sum transfers are available. 
The optimality of progressive income taxes results from inefficiently high labor supply. The mechanism is simple: when labor income taxes are not redistributed lump sum, a wedge between households' shadow value of income and the social one emerges.  As a result, labor supply is too high. 
This is a novel motive for income taxation.
Following this intuition, environmental and labor income taxes complement each other in the optimal environmental policy absent lump-sum transfers. The higher environmental tax revenues, the higher the distortion in households' income and output. 
% I argue that environmental and income taxes are complements. The first is targeted at the environmental externality while the second serves to mitigate distortions in the labor market resulting from environmental taxation.
  
%\paragraph{Analytic findings 2}
%\textbf{Pigou principle violated absent lump-sum transfers and efficient allocation not feasible}
I consider two cases how environmental tax revenues are recycled. First, revenues are consumed by the government, and, second, the government redistributes revenues via the income tax scheme. In the first scenario, I find that the optimal environmental tax does not satisfy the Pigou principle: it does not necessarily equal the social cost of the externality. %As demonstrated by \textit{Pigou xxx}, setting the environmental tax equal to the marginal costs arising from the polluting activity that are not private (the so-called social cost) is optimal. The idea is that polluters behave as if internalizing the social cost of their action when confronted with the environmental tax. I show that when environmental tax revenues are consumed by the government, the Pigou principle is violated. 
In this case, the motive to increase private consumption by lowering environmental tax revenues makes a deviation of the environmental tax from the social cost of the externality optimal.
Furthermore, when labor supply is elastic non-redistribution of environmental tax revenues results in inefficiently high hours worked. Then, the optimal labor tax is progressive to diminish work effort closer to the efficient level.
Nevertheless, the efficient allocation is not feasible under this policy regime, since either consumption is inefficiently low or work effort is too high. 

%
%\paragraph{Analytic findings 3}
%\textbf{Efficient allocation can be implemented through redistribution via income tax scheme}
%The inefficiency of the optimal allocation when environmental tax revenues are consumed by the government motivates to point to a 
In the second scenario, the Ramsey planner redistributes environmental tax revenues through the income tax scheme; now, the efficient allocation is attainable. The optimal income tax scheme is again progressive. By redistributing environmental tax revenues, consumption can be chosen efficiently high while the labor income tax scheme handles too high labor supply. In fact, redistribution via the income tax scheme incentivizes more labor supply. A progressive income tax scheme counteracts this tendency restoring the efficient level of hours worked. 
In this setting, the Pigou principle holds, since there is no trade-off between lowering the externality and consumption.
%More precisely, I study the optimal policy mix of environmental and labor income taxes to meet emission limits. 
%I find that progressive labor income taxes are used in concert with fossil taxes to optimally reduce emissions. 
% First, I propose a tractable model to provide intuition for this result: Non-lump-sum redistribution of environmental tax revenues increase the gains from labor. Leisure becomes more expensive and households do not reduce their labor supply efficiently in response to the fossil tax. To reduce hours to the efficient level, income taxes complement the fossil tax to lower hours to the efficient level.  
% 
% 
% 
%Second, I assess the importance of this novel role for income taxes in a quantitative endogenous growth model:
%Even though a more progressive tax reduces research effort  and recomposes production towards the fossil sector, the optimal tax is progressive. 


%\subsubsection*{Quantitative exercise}
In this and the subsequent two paragraphs, I motivate the quantitative exercise and expound the model.
Even though I have shown theoretically that progressive income taxes form one pillar of the optimal environmental policy when environmental tax revenues are not redistributed lump sum, it is not clear whether progressivity remains optimal in a more realistic, quantitative model. 
Two countering mechanisms of tax progressivity shall be considered here.
First, endogenous growth could make a more regressive income tax optimal to incentivize innovation. The size of the market for successful innovation positively affects the profitability of research investment. Subsidizing labor supply through regressive taxes boosts technological growth. Second, a skill bias in the green sector renders regressive income taxes advantageous by enhancing supply of the green sector-specific input good. In the model, high-skill workers supply more labor due to a wage premium. Therefore, they are more responsive to the substitution effect as income tax progressivity makes leisure cheaper. Then, the economy transitions to a higher dirty production share. Directed technical change amplifies this recomposing effect of the income tax. 

% relation to core model and to fried;
In light of these two mechanisms calling for income tax regressivity, I extend the core model studied in the analytical section by adding endogenous growth and skill heterogeneity. The resulting model builds on \cite{Fried2018ClimateAnalysis}. It enhances aforementioned work by an optimal policy analysis, the availability of income taxes, and skill heterogeneity. 
% no income inequality: trade off as in classical 
I maintain the assumption of a representative family which consists of two skill types. Within the family, all workers consume the same. Thus, workers remain perfectly insured against income differentials so that equity concerns do not drive the optimal policy. The trade-off shaping the optimal policy stays within the boundaries of traditional environmental policy considerations: growth versus externality mitigation \citep{Stokey1998AreGrowth, Jones2016LifeGrowth, Acemoglu2012TheChange}.  This modeling choice allows to focus the analysis on environmental externality aspects which shape the optimal tax progressivity from an environmental perspective.

%\paragraph{How the externality is modeled}
In the quantitative model, the government cares about the externality due to an exogenous constraint on emissions and not via household utility. This approach, known as a cost-effectiveness approach in the environmental literature, has the advantage of reducing modeling and parametric uncertainty when specifying how greenhouse-gas emissions affect the climate and the damages it produces in terms of well-being and production. Instead, the cost-effectiveness approach uses estimated emission targets stemming from meta studies of more complex integrated assessment models. Additionally, the emission limits I use to calibrate the model are designed to meet climate targets constituting a politically relevant environment. 
% think about the relation of an absolute emission target and not reducing hours

%\paragraph{Endogenous growth}
Allowing for endogenous growth is important to take seriously the possibility of green growth to keep consumption high while meeting emission targets. Endogenous growth introduces dynamics into the model since today's level of technology positively depends on yesterday's technology: a \textit{standing on the shoulder of giants} mechanism.  


%The model differentiates between high- and low-skill labor to account for a skill bias found for the green sector \citep{Consoli2016DoCapital}. This asymmetry of sectors renders regressive taxes a tool to lower relative production costs in the green sector: high-skill workers reduce their labor supply more in response to a more progressive tax as leisure is more valuable to them. This recomposing mechanism counteracts intentions to lower emissions. %, a regressive tax functions as a green subsidy. % In fact, there is an externality arising from high-skill labor supply as it shapes the share of fossil to green energy production. 
%On the other hand, progressive income taxes lower aggregate production by diminishing the price of leisure. 
%Endogenous growth amplifies the repercussions of progressive income taxes:
%First, a lower labor supply reduces the profitability of research in general. By reducing hours worked the planner sacrifices technological progress. Secondly, the recomposing effect is aggravated as research is directed towards the sector with the increased labor share, i.e. the fossil sector.

%\paragraph{Calibration}
The model is calibrated to the US in the baseline period from 2015 to 2019. To do so, I proceed in two steps. First, I set certain parameters to values found in the literature. Most importantly, I use reasonable values of production and growth processes found in \cite{Fried2018ClimateAnalysis}. % who conducts a rigorous calibration exercise. 
With these parameter values at hand, I match the share of high skill in the green and non-green sectors building on \cite{Consoli2016DoCapital}. The emission target is set to the values suggested in the latest IPCC draft on mitigation pathways \citep{IPCC2022}: A 50\% reduction by 2030 relative to 2019 levels and  net-zero emissions from 2050 onward.

%\paragraph{Quantitative exercise}
I perform the following quantitative exercise. 
 The planner sets the environmental tax and the progressivity parameter of the non-linear income tax scheme to maximize welfare while satisfying the emission limit. Environmental tax revenues are consumed by the government. As discussed in the analytical section, under this policy regime the efficient allocation is not feasible, but, it is  more policy relevant. 

%I am taking a political economy perspective on the maximization problem
I solve the Ramsey model explicitly for 55 years starting from 2020. The presented analysis does not seek to solve an infinite-horizon problem. The focus on utility of households living during the transition period is legitimate given their importance for political feasibility
\citep[compare][]{Fried2018TheGenerations}.
Absent a value assigned to periods beyond 2075, the optimal allocation features decreasing innovation inputs as future gains from innovation today are not captured.
Yet, there exist political tendencies to take into account future populations. The \cite{UNSUS} formulated a sustainable development criterion stressing care for future populations regarding environmental and economic needs. 
Therefore, I derive a continuation value to approximate the value of innovation for the future.\footnote{\ This approach enables me to mitigate end-point problems in a dynamic setting, while at the same time do not have to assume the existence of a balanced growth path. In presence of an absolute emission limit, the structure of the model requires continues adjustments in policy instruments complicating the derivation of a balanced growth path.
 In other studies investigating dynamic policies \citep{Jones1993OptimalGrowth, Barrage2019OptimalPolicy}, %\cite{Jones1993OptimalGrowth} assume (p.487) \textit{ In all these exercises, we assume that both solutions to the planner's problems exist (in particular, the feasible set of policy plans is non- empty) and that the time paths of these solutions converge to steady- state growth paths}.}
a continuation value is added to the periods which typically relies on balanced growth assumptions with constant ratios and constant policies; such assumptions seem unjustified  in the present economy.
Under the assumption that taxes remain fixed in order to solve for the balanced growth path, market forces most likely would violate the emission limit. }
%\textit{ also look at \cite{Conesa2009TaxingAll} who make some argument about bgp preferences: to allow for a broader set of parameters, they abstract from growth}
%Furthermore, as the emission limit is absolute, an ever increasing technology level (which is the case under decreasing returns to research), the use of fossil labor and machines has to decline towards zero.

% Instead, I constrain the planner to focus on the 60 year period during which the economy needs to transition to the zero-emission target. To make the planner care about future periods, I adopt a sustainability-type of condition: the potential to grow in terms of technology has to be at least as high as today.\footnote{\ Absent this condition, technological progress today is less valuable. The value of the technology level for future periods - due to the dynamic structure of innovation - is not taken into account. } 
% What is left to future generations in terms of production has some lower bound. 
% The productive asset inherited from predecessors is the technology level in the present model. 
 

  


% The planner is constrained by a sustainability motive to leave at least as much resources to future periods than for the explicitly modeled periods.\footnote{\ \tr{To be done}}
%This approach has the advantage of not having to assume the existence of a balanced growth path. Given that one factor of production, fossil energy, is bounded by an exogenous limit, I seek to stay agnostic on this aspect.
%\tr{\textit{Alternative: assume the economy reaches a BGP in some future period; all variables grow at constant rates. Possible?}}

%\paragraph{Findings}
%\textbf{Progressive income tax}
The findings in the quantitative analysis affirm optimality of progressive income taxes. Over time, progressivity shrinks.
Labor income taxes mainly serve as complements to lower inefficiently high labor supply as studied in the analytical section. 
In addition, labor income taxes have a role as substitutes for environmental taxes emerging from endogenous growth.
Since the fossil sector is the most technologically advanced, it boosts growth in the other sectors through knowledge spillovers. This renders fossil taxes especially costly. Lowering production levels through the income tax, instead, allows to profit from knowledge spillovers. In this channel, environmental and income taxes are substitutes. 
Overall, the results suggest a clear cut between responsibilities of policy instruments, since the environmental tax remains largely unchanged compared to the benchmark setting.  The environmental tax targets the externality, whereas the income tax handles the inefficiency arising from environmental tax revenues. When depriving the government from an income tax scheme, 
%The tax progressivity comes at the costs of lower consumption and an adverse green-to-fossil energy ratio.

% despite its repercussions on growth and emissions. Indeed, this policy increases the share of fossil to green energy and reduces research efforts and consumption. %As the emission limit becomes tighter over time, the Ramsey planner augments both the environmental tax and income tax progressivity. 
%In general, income tax progressivity and the environmental tax appear to be complements: as the emission limit becomes tighter, the two increase. Yet, with introduction of the net-zero emission limit, income tax progressivity decreases on impact. 
%The positive correlation between income tax progressivity and the environmental tax is in line with the analytical finding.

% complements


% importance of endogenous growth
To shed light on the role of endogenous growth and skill heterogeneity, I rerun the analysis in modified models simplifying separately on either dimension. 
Both, endogenous growth and skill heterogeneity make income tax progressivity more costly in the model's framework, and abstracting from either ingredient leads to a higher optimal tax progressivity. 
Endogenous growth accounts for the relatively quick decrease in labor tax progressivity. When there is only one type of skill, the optimal policy achieves a labor supply close to the efficient one. Intuitively, income tax progressivity is less costly as the adverse recomposing affect on the energy ratio and the energy share is not present.
Interestingly, the environmental tax required to meet emission limits in the model with homogeneous skill is higher. This finding is explained by a level effect on fossil production as its labor supply increases (compared to the heterogeneous skill model a bigger supply of fossil-specific labor is available). Therefore, the environmental tax is higher to reduce the share of fossil energy even further. This highlights the priority of corrective taxes to reduce emissions. 

%The reason is that more research effort loses in value as consumption increases. As dynamic spill overs of the research process advance, an additional unit of research effort is not compensated by enough from more consumption. \textit{\tr{This might be due to the missing continuation value! }}

%To understand this finding, it is informative to look at a setting with lump-sum transfers. Then, the motive to use lump-sum taxes to reduce labor supply vanishes. The labor tax can, however, be used to boost growth through a market-size mechanism by enhancing labor supply. Indeed, in such a setting the optimal labor income tax is progressive. Yet, regressivity reduces similar to the result without lump-sum transfers. The reason for this gradual increase is that in  the emission limit prevents the usage of labor income taxes to boost growth.
%More labor supply causes more emissions especially the more progressed the technology. With only a labor income tax as a tool to raise growth, accelerating technology growth issions. Indeed, this policy increases the share of fossil to green energy and reduces research efforts and consumption. %As the emission limit becomes tighter over time, the Ramsey planner augments both the environmental tax and income tax progressivity. 
%In general, income tax progressivity ands not feasible as it is concomitant with more production and emissions.
