\section{Quantitative results}\label{sec:res}

In this section, I present and discuss the quantitative results.
Subsection \ref{subsec:mr} depicts the optimal policy given the emission target. Subsection \ref{subsec:dis} discusses the results. In particular, I focus on analyzing the mechanisms and welfare benefits from integrating the income tax scheme into the environmental policy. 

\subsection{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item benefits of an integrated environmental policy: comparison benchmark model to version where government consumes env tax revenues and no taul
	\item with lump-sum transfers: is taul used for different purpose? without endogenous growth should be zero
\end{itemize}
