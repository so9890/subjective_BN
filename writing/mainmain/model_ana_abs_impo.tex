%\end{enumerate}

This section develops a general model which is at the core of deriving the analytical results. In section yyy, the model is extended to a quantitative framework. %investigate the inefficiency arising in hours worked when an environmental externality has to be taken care of. 

The representative household faces a consumption and labor supply decision. The final consumption good is a composite of a dirty and a clean good. Labor is the only input to production. For simplicity the clean sector does not induce any externality; yet, whenever intermediate goods are no perfect substitutes, final good production is never perfectly clean. The model abstracts from endogenous growth and becomes static. 

\paragraph{Representative household}
The representative household maximises its life-time utility which in the static model corresponds to maximising the period utility
\begin{align}
U(C,H; F)
\end{align} 

The household derives utility from consumption, $C$, but experiences disutility from the hours spent working, $H$. An externality from dirty (or fossil) production, $F$, decreases household utility and is taken as given by the household.
I assume additive separability of consumption, hours, and the externality. I further assume that utility of consumption is increasing and concave. As regards hours and the externality, utilty is decreasing and convex.
Utility maximization is subject to a budget constraint
\begin{align}
	 C= \lambda(wH)^{1-\tau_{\iota}}+T_{ls}. \label{eq:hhbudget}
\end{align}

The varibale $w$ indicates the wage rate, and $T_{ls}$ denotes lump-sum transfers from the government.
The planner levies income taxes on labor income using a non-linear tax scheme common in the public finance literature \citep{Heathcote2017OptimalFramework, Benabou2002TaxEfficiency}. The tax scheme is
characterized by a scaling factor, $\lambda$, which determines the level of average tax revenues in the economy and a measure of the tax progressivity denoted by $\tau_{\iota}$. 
\cite{Heathcote2017OptimalFramework} show that whenever $\tau_{\iota}>0$ the tax scheme is progressive since the marginal tax rate exceeds the average tax rate irrespective of  pre-tax labor income. Hence, as labor income increases, average tax payments increase, too. An alternative intuition is that when $\tau_{\iota}>0$, the elasticity of post- to pre-tax labor income is smaller unity for all levels of pre-tax labor income.  %\footnote{\ I show that the result is equivalent with a linear tax rate in the appendix.} 

\paragraph{Production}
All sectors of production are perfectly competitive. The final consumption good, $Y$, is a composite of the dirty, $F$, and the clean intermediate good, $G$. 
Intermediate goods are produced from labor, $L_j$, and technology, $A_j$, where $j\in \{f,g\}$ indicates the dirty and the clean sector.
\begin{align}
Y=F_Y(F, G), \hspace{5mm} F=F_F(A_f, L_f),\hspace{5mm} G=F_G(A_g, L_g) \label{eq:prod}
\end{align}

\paragraph{Government}
The government raises income taxes from households and levies ad-valorem sales taxes, $\tau_f$, on dirty producers' revenues $p_fF$, where $p_f$ denotes the price of the dirty good paid by final good producers. Revenues from the income tax and the environmental tax are treated separately by the government. Income tax revenues are fully redistributed through the income tax schedule while environmental tax revenues are either lump-sum redistributed to households, $T_{ls}$, consumed by the government, $Gov$, or redistributed through the income tax scheme, $T_\iota$:
\begin{align}
\tau_{f}p_fF=T_{ls}+T_\iota+Gov, \hspace{7mm}
0={w h}-\lambda(w h)^{1-\tau_{\iota}}+T_\iota. \label{eq:gov_but}
\end{align}
%Environmental tax revenues are either transferred lump-sum, fully consumed by the government, or transferred through the income tax schedule.

\paragraph{Markets}
The market for labor and the final good both clear: 
\begin{align}
H=L_f+L_g\ \hspace{5mm} Y=C+Gov \label{eq:market_clear}
\end{align}
 The final good, $Y$, is the numéraire.
%I summarize the equations determining the competitive equilibrium in appendix section \ref{app:model}.
\subsection{Competitive equilibrium}
In a competitive equilibrium, household behavior is described by the budget constraint, equation \ref{eq:hhbudget}, and labor supply which follows from the household first order conditions and substituion of $\lambda$ from the government's budget on the income tax:
\begin{align}
-U_H=U_C(1-\tau_{\iota})w\left(1+\frac{T_\iota}{wH}\right). \label{eq:hsup}
\end{align}
Production is described by equations \ref{eq:prod} and prices follow from firms' profit maximization:
\begin{align}
p_g=\frac{\partial Y}{\partial G}, \hspace{5mm}
p_f = \frac{\partial Y}{\partial F}, \hspace{5mm}
w= p_f(1-\tau_f)\frac{\partial F}{\partial L_f}=p_g\frac{\partial G}{\partial L_g}\label{eq:profmax}
\end{align}

The competitive equilibrium is defined as a set of variables so that households and firms behave optimally; i.e. equations \ref{eq:hhbudget}, \ref{eq:hsup} and \ref{eq:profmax} hold. Production happens according to \ref{eq:prod}. Finally, markets clear, equations \ref{eq:market_clear}, and the governments budgets are satisfied \ref{eq:gov_but}.

\section{Theoretic results}
 I derive and discuss the main theoretical results in subsection \ref{subsec:decen_ec}. Before, subsection \ref{subsec:sp} defines and derives the efficient allocation as a benchmark for the optimal allocation which results under a Ramsey planner. 

\subsection{Social planner}\label{subsec:sp}
Let the share of dirty to total labor be denoted by $s=L_f/H$. The social planner's problem reads
\begin{align}
\underset{s, H}{\max}\ & U(C,H; F)\\ s.t\ \ & C=Y.
\end{align}
The first order conditions are given by
\begin{align}
wrt.\ s:\hspace{4mm} & U_C\left(\frac{dY}{dF}\frac{dF}{ds}+\frac{dY}{dG}\frac{dG}{ds}\right)=-U_F\frac{dF}{ds}, \label{eq:fbs}
\\
wrt.\ H:\hspace{4mm} & U_C\frac{dY}{dH}+U_F\frac{dF}{dH}=-U_H\label{eq:fbh}. 
\end{align}
These equations determine the efficient or first-best allocation. 
Absent an externality, $U_F=0$, the efficient distribution of labor across sectors equalizes the marginal product of labor across sectors; compare equation \ref{eq:fbs}. Efficient hours balance the marginal utility gain from consumption and the disutility from working; see equation \ref{eq:fbh}. 

When there is an externality, the social planner adjusts the allocation by two modulations: a (i) recomposing and a (ii) scaling one. 
The recomposition is determined by equation \ref{eq:fbs}.
The negative externality of dirty production  lowers the efficient share of labor allocated to  the dirty sector so that the marginal product of labor in the dirty sector exceeds the marginal product in the clean sector; note that $U_F<0$ by assumption so that the right-hand side is positive and that $\frac{dG}{ds}<0$.
\begin{comment}
The equation 
\begin{align}
\frac{-U_F}{U_C \frac{dY}{dF}}=1+\frac{\frac{dY}{dG}\frac{dG}{ds}}{\frac{dY}{dF}\frac{dF}{ds}}.
\end{align}
The term on the left-hand side is the social cost of the externality: it measures what the representative household is willing to pay for a further reduction in dirty production. 
\end{comment}

The scaling effect is summarized by equation \ref{eq:fbh}.
There are two reasons for why the efficient amount of hours worked changes. 
First, the recomposition of labor input towards the  clean sector reduces the marginal product of labor, $\frac{dY}{dH}$, and the marginal increase in consumption for an additional hour worked declines.  This effect has two opposing impacts on the efficient labor supply. On the one hand, there is a substitution effect: as leisure becomes less costly, the efficient amount of hours reduces (note that the right-hand side is increasing in $H$). On the other hand, the economy becomes poorer and more work effort might become efficient. This is equivalent to an income effect captured by the term $U_C$. 
%In total, which effect dominates depends on the curvature of the utility from consumption, $\theta$. With $\theta>1$ the  lower marginal product of labor decreases the efficient amount of hours worked. 
Second, the social planner reduces hours worked due to their negative exeternality through dirty production. This effect is introduced by the fraction $U_F\frac{dF}{dH}<0$. 

Depending on the importance of the income effect, efficient hours worked may be higher or lower than  absent an externality. %\footnote{ \ I discuss in the appendix conditions on parameter values when assuming functional forms of the model.}
\tr{I will show in the following, that irrespective of whether the social planner de- or increases hours, the decentralized economy always features higher hours when the environmental tax is set to implement the efficient share of dirty labor, that is, lump-sum transfers are not available and environmental tax revenues are consumed by the government. 
}

\begin{comment}
\hrule
One can show that the total effect of a drop in the dirty labor share on hours worked is positive, i.e. $\frac{dh_{FB}}{ds}>0$, if $\theta<\frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon-s}$. If the income effect dominates, the social planner increases hours worked as the economy becomes less productive. 
Under the value for $\theta$ suggested by \cite{Boppart2019LaborPerspectiveb}, the efficient scale effect is to increase hours worked. When, however, the substitution effect outweighs or dominates the income effect - as commonly assumed in the public finance literature \citep{Heathcote2017OptimalFramework, LansBovenberg1994EnvironmentalTaxation, LansBovenberg1996OptimalAnalyses} \tr{CHECK this}!.
Nevertheless, the level of hours worked exceeds the efficient level irrespective of $\theta$ when no lump-sum transfers are available. 
When the efficient level of hours increases, though, the dirty labor share reduces even more to outweigh the increase in the externality.

\subsection{Decentralized economy}\label{subsec:decen_ec}

How can the efficient allocation be decentralized by the use of taxes and transfers in a competitive economy? %For now, I assume that the income tax is not available and $\tau_{\iota}=0$, $\lambda=0$.
I show in this section that redistribution of environmental tax revenues are essential to implement the first-best allocation in the competitive equilibrium. Only in combination with lump-sum transfers of  environmental tax revenues, does an environmental tax suffice to implement the efficient allocation. 
When lump-sum transfers are not available, a role for income taxes to lower hours worked arises. I consider two cases.
In the first case, environmental tax revenues are consumed by the government. Under the assumption of non-increasing returns to scale, the optimal policy consists of (i) a progressive labor income tax scheme and (ii) an environmental tax which deviates from the social cost of the externality. The Pigou principle is violated. Nevertheless, the efficient allocation is not feasible under this policy set-up.
However, as  I will demonstrate in the second scenario, redistributing environmental tax revenues through the income tax scheme may restore the efficient allocation. Again, the optimal tax scheme is progressive to lower hours worked.
As a consequence,  optimal environmental policies which restore the efficient allocation feature - as a side effect - a more equal distribution of income, through either lump-sum transfers or a progressive tax scheme.% \tr{Not sure though if this holds true in progressive scheme as lambda multiplies labor income}).

\begin{enumerate}
\item lump-sum transfers important for Pigou tax to implement efficient allocation: Proposition \ref{prop:1}
\item when transfers are not redistributed: infeasibility of efficient allocation,  role for labor tax, and violation of Pigou principle \ref{prop:2}.
\item redistribution through income tax scheme with progressive income tax restores efficient allocation \ref{prop:3}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Government problem}\label{subsec:Rams}
The government is characterized by a Ramsey planner: it seeks to maximize utility of the representative household but can only revert to tax instruments and transfers to implement the optimal allocation. Furthermore, the behavior of firms and households constrain the government's optimization problem. 
The Ramsey problem is defined as
\begin{align}
\underset{s, H}{\max}\ & U(C,H; F)\\ s.t\ \ & C=Y-Gov\\ & \text{behavior of firms and households}.
\end{align}
The optimality conditions differ from the social planner's ones through the derivatives on government revenues, $Gov$:
\begin{align}
wrt.\ s:\hspace{4mm} & U_C\left(\frac{\partial Y}{\partial F}\frac{\partial F}{\partial s}+\frac{\partial Y}{\partial G}\frac{\partial G}{\partial s}-\frac{\partial Gov}{ \partial s}\right)=-U_F\frac{\partial F}{\partial s}, \label{eq:sbs}
\\
wrt.\ H:\hspace{4mm} & U_C\left(\frac{\partial Y}{\partial H}-\frac{\partial Gov}{\partial H}\right)+U_F\frac{\partial F}{\partial H}=-U_H\label{eq:sbh}. 
\end{align}

%-- paragraph to show that with Gov=0 and lump-sum transfers, the efficient allocation is implemented
When environmental tax revenues are fully redistributed lump-sum, i.e. $Gov=0$, $T_\iota=0$, then the Pigou principle implements the efficient allocation and the optimal income tax scheme is linear with a marginal rate of zero. 
To see this, note that equation \ref{eq:sbs} ensures that the social planner's first order condition, equation \ref{eq:fbs}, is satisfied. 
The condition can be rewritten to highlight that the optimal environmental tax equals the social cost of pollution\footnote{\ I derive the social cost of pollution as the price the representative household is willing to pay for a marginal reduction in dirty production. The derivation is exponded in appendix section \ref{sec:mod_an}. To be precise, social cost of pollution refers to the marginal cost evaluated at the resulting equilibrium allocation.}: The Pigou principle. 
\begin{align}
\underbrace{\frac{-U_F}{U_C\frac{\partial Y}{\partial F}}}_{\text{marginal social cost of dirty production}}=1+\frac{\frac{\partial Y}{\partial G}\frac{\partial G}{\partial s}}{\frac{\partial Y}{\partial F}\frac{\partial F}{\partial s}}=\tau^*_f.
\end{align}

Where the second equality follows from substituting intermediate firms' profit maximization conditions from equation \ref{eq:profmax}. 
As discussed previously, absent an externality of production it is efficient to balance marginal products of labor across sectors. However, when there is an externality, the social planner lowers the dirty share of labor which results in a higher marginal product of labor in the dirty sector. To sustain this gap between marginal products in the efficient allocation, the government has to introduce a dirt tax so that market forces do not direct labor towards the sector with the higher marginal product. In other words, the dirt tax is set so that wage rates equalize despite heterogeneous marginal products of labor. As a result of this intervention, the equilibrium wage rate is below the marginal product of labor in the dirty sector.\footnote{\ \tr{To be shown in the general model \textbf{MAYBE done?}}} These are efficiency costs associated with a use of the environmental tax. They are the source of the competition between environmental good provision and raising government funds or equity alluded to in the literature \citep{LansBovenberg1994EnvironmentalTaxation}.  

In a next step, I show, that setting the environmental tax optimally, implies that the second first order condition of the Ramsey planner is satisfied at $\tau_\iota=0$ when $Gov=0$ and $T_\iota=0$, that is, all environmental tax revenues are redistributed lump-sum: $T_{ls}=\tau_{f}p_fF$.

Noticing that $\frac{\partial Y}{\partial H}= \frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}\frac{s}{H}-\frac{\partial Y}{\partial G}\frac{\partial G}{\partial s}\frac{1}{H}$ and that $\frac{\partial F}{\partial H}=\frac{\partial F}{\partial s}\frac{s}{H}$, and substituting equation \ref{eq:sbs} in equation \ref{eq:sbh} yields
\begin{align}
-U_C \frac{\partial Y}{\partial G}\frac{\partial G}{\partial s}\frac{1}{H}=-U_H
\end{align}
Substituting $U_H$ from household optimality, equation \ref{eq:hsup}, and the clean sectors' profit maximizing condition from equations \ref{eq:profmax} yields
\begin{align}
1=1-\tau^*_\iota.
\end{align}
Hence, $\tau^*_\iota =0$ from which follows that $\lambda =1$ so that the income tax scheme is a flat tax rate equal to zero; the labor income tax is not used in optimum.


\subsubsection{Optimal environmental policy without lump-sum transfers}
In this section, I argue for the importance of lump-sum transfers to implement the efficient allocation in a competitive economy. \textbf{Lump-sum transfers serve to reduce hours worked through an income effect. }
This is the first main result summarized in proposition \ref{prop:1} below. 

\begin{prop}\label{prop:1}
Absent lump-sum transfers, the Pigou principle, i.e. $\tau_f=SCC$ is suboptimal. Without any other policy measure, hours worked are inefficiently high; lump-sum transfers serve to reduce hours worked.
\end{prop}
\tr{To be shown. }


\begin{prop}\label{prop:2}
When environmental tax revenues are not redistributed lump-sum but instead consumed by the government, i.e. $Gov=\tau_fp_fF$ and $T_{ls}=T_\iota=0$, then (i) the Pigou principle is violated and (ii) a motive for labor taxation arises. The optimal income tax scheme is progressive. % if the aggregate production function features decreasing or constant returns to scale. 
The efficient allocation is infeasible.  
\end{prop}

\paragraph{Optimal environmental tax}
One can show that under the optimal policy the environmental tax equals
	\begin{align}
\tau_{f}^*= SCC+\frac{\partial Gov}{\partial s}\frac{1}{\frac{\partial Y}{\partial F}\frac{\partial F}{\partial s}}.
\end{align}
This can be further simplified:
\begin{align}
\tau_f^* = 1-\frac{SCC}{\frp{w}{s}}w. 
\end{align}
A condition for $\tau_f$ to exceed the social cost of the externality reads
\begin{align}
SCC<\frac{1}{1+\frac{w}{\frp{w}{s}}}
\end{align}
If government revenues increase with the share of dirty labor, then the optimal environmental tax exceeds the social cost of pollution in equilibrium. 	

\paragraph{Optimal labor income tax}
The optimal labor income tax progressivity parameter is given by 
\begin{align}\label{eq:nls_taulopt}
\tau_\iota^*=\frac{1}{w}\frp{w}{s}_{F=\bar{F}}.
\end{align}
\tr{Check this result in matlab}
In words, the optimal income tax progressivity parameter equals the semi-elasticity of the wage rate in response to a decrease in the green labor share but keeping dirty production unchanged. 
Since the environmental tax serves to sustain a gap between marginal products of labor, thereby  reducing the wage rate, a lower labor share in clean production increases the wage rate. As a result, the labor income tax scheme is progressive: $\tau_\iota>0$. For a proof and the derivation of the optimal income tax progressivity parameter see appendix section \ref{app:subsub_nltaul}.

% In the same section of the appendix, I prove that $\tau_\iota^*>0$ if clean production and aggregate production feature constant or decreasing returns to scale and at least one produces with decreasing returns to scale. An assumption satisfied under Cobb-Douglas or constant elasticity of substitution production functions when goods are substitutes. When goods are complements, then...  
 
% \tr{Only direct effect, not a general equilibrium result}
% \begin{corollary}
% Absent income taxes, hours worked are inefficiently high when production features decreasing or constant returns to scale. 
% \end{corollary}
% As a corollary of proposition \ref{prop:2}, it follows that absent income taxes, hours worked are inefficiently high. This follows directly from the houeshold's first order condition:  a positive value of $\tau_\iota$ ireduces the right-hand side. Since the marginal utility is decreasing in hours the left-hand side is a positive function of labor supply. Hence, as the right-hand side decreases, hours diminish.   
% 
 
 \paragraph{Discussion optimal policy}
 xxx
 Why is $\tau_\iota$ progressive?
 
 \paragraph{Infeasibility of efficient allocation}
 \tr{Continue}
 \begin{proof}\textit{The efficient allocation is infeasible (under the assumption of constant or decreasing returns to scale)}
 	To prove this claim, I assume that the government chooses the optimal policy; which is the highest social welfare the Ramsey planner can achieve. I show that the optimal policy does not satisfy the social planner's allocation. Since the social planner could have chosen the Ramsey planner's allocation  but did not, it follows that the social planner's allocation features a higher social welfare.
 	
For the optimal allocation to be efficient, it must be the case that $s^*=s_{FB}$, (i) $C^*=C_{FB}$, and (ii) $H^*=H_{FB}$. I show that, under the assumption that $s^*=s_{FB}$, either (i) or (ii) can hold at a time by demonstrating that assuming (i), (ii) is violated and vice versa.


\begin{lemma}{If $s^*=s_{FB}$ and $H^*=H_{FB}$, then $w<MPL_{FB}$}.
	\tr{To be written up}
\end{lemma}

%\begin{lemma}\textit{$\tau_f=0$ is not optimal}
%When $\tau_f=0$ then $Gov=0$ and $\frp{Gov}{s}=0$. Furthermore, market forces then imply that the marginal products of labor are equal so that $\frp{Y}{F}\frp{F}{s}=-\frp{Y}{G}\frp{G}{s}$. Substituting this in equation \ref{eq:sbs} yields
%\begin{align}
%0=-U_F\frp{F}{s}>0,
%\end{align}
%a contradiction. 
%\end{lemma}
%
%\textit{(i) Assume $C^*=C_{FB}$ and $s^*=s_{FB}$:}
%Since $\tau_f\neq0$, it follows that $Gov>0$ and hence $Y^*=C^*+Gov>Y_{FB}$. Since the allocation of labor is the same in the efficient and the optimal allocation and output is rising in labor, it follows that $H^*>H_{FB}$. 
%\tr{Missing: if $\tau_f<0$ then $Gov<0$ }

Assume, 
The social planner's first order condition on labor supply can be written as
\begin{align}
-U_{H, FB}=U_{C, FB}\frp{Y}{G}_{FB}\frp{G}{L_g}_{FB}
\end{align}
and optimal labor supply is determined by
\begin{align}
-U^*_{H}&=U^*_C(1-\tau_\iota)w
\end{align}
Equalizing yields
\begin{align}
U_C^*(1-\tau_\iota)w=U_{C,FB}\frp{Y}{G}_{FB}\frp{G}{L_g}_{FB},
\end{align}
a condition for optimal labor supply to be efficient. 

In the following, I demonstrate that (i) assuming $C^*=C_{FB}$ violates the condition above and $H^*\neq H_{FB}$ and that (ii) assuming $H^*=H_{FB}$ results in $C^*<C_{FB}$. 

\textit{(i) Assume $C^*=C_{FB}$:}
then
\begin{align}
(1-\tau_\iota)w=\frp{Y}{G}_{FB}\frp{G}{L_g}_{FB}.
\end{align}
Assume by contradiction that $H^*=H_{FB}$, since $s^*=s_{FB}$ by assumption, it follows that $w=\frp{Y}{G}_{FB}\frp{G}{L_g}_{FB}$. 
Since $\tau_\iota\neq 0$ under constant or decreasing returns to scale, it holds that $H^*<H_{FB}$, a contradiction. 


%Hence,
%\begin{align}
%(1-\tau_\iota)w<\frp{Y}{G}_{FB}\frp{G}{L_g}_{FB}.
%\end{align}
%
%Labor supply in the competitive equilibrium is lower than in the efficient allocation when consumption is equal under the optimal policy. WHY?
%It follows, that optimal labor supply does not equal its efficient counterpart when optimal consumption is efficient.

\textit{(ii) Assume $H^*=H_{FB}$:} 
It follows that 
\begin{align}
\frac{U_C^*}{U_{C,FB}}=\frac{\frp{Y}{G}_{FB}\frp{G}{L_g}_{FB}}{w}\frac{1}{1-\tau_\iota}=\frac{1}{1-\tau_\iota}>1.
\end{align}
From concavity of the utility function it follows that $C^*<C_{FB}$.

\paragraph{Discussion}
\textit{Thus, my findings counter the idea of a double dividend of environmental taxation more generally than \cite{LansBovenberg1994EnvironmentalTaxation}. They argue that there is no double dividend because env. taxes exert efficiency costs. In this paper, I argue that to implement the efficient allocation, there is no choice how to use environmental tax revenues. They form an integer part of the optimal environmental policy to lower hours worked while keeping consumption high.}

\subsubsection{Optimal policy with combined environmental and fiscal policy}

In this subsection, I still assume that lump-sum transfers are not available, yet, government redistributes environmental tax revenues through the income tax scheme.
Under this policy, the government runs a combined budget of environmental and labor income tax revenues:  
\begin{align}
Gov= wh-\lambda (wH)^{1-\tau_\iota}+\tau_f p_fF.
\end{align}
The budget is balanced and $Gov = 0$ which determines $\lambda=\frac{w_h + \tau_f p_f F}{(wh)^{1-\tau_{\iota}}}$. The efficiency result is summarized in proposition \ref{prop:3}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:3}
	If lump-sum transfers are not available, the government can implement the efficient allocation by  transferring environmental tax revenues through the income tax scheme. The optimal tax scheme is progressive if aggregate production features constant or decreasing returns to labor.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}\textit{The optimal allocation is efficient}
\end{proof}

\begin{proof} \textit{The optimal income tax scheme is progressive if aggregate production features decreasing or constant returns to scale}\\
Under the new policy, the household's labor supply is determined by
\begin{align}
-U_H=\frac{U_C (1-\tau_{\iota})(wH+\tau_f p_fF)}{H}.
\end{align}
Expressing the derivatives in the Ramsey planner's first order condition with respect to hours as derivatives with respect to the dirty labor share, $s$, and substituting the first order condition with respect to $s$ yields:
\begin{align}
U_C \frp{Y}{G}\frp{G}{L_g}=-U_H.
\end{align}
\tr{Does this give a hint to why inefficiency without redistribution? The Ramsey planner's foc and household optimality always coincide. But, when Gov does not cancel the two do not coincide! ? the two do not coincide, Bcs consumption is too low so that $U_C$ too high which increases}
Noticing that $\frp{Y}{G}\frp{G}{L_g}=w$ and replacing household's labor supply condition gives
\begin{align}
& w=\frac{(1-\tau_\iota)Y}{H}\\
\Leftrightarrow\ & \tau_\iota=1-\frac{wH}{Y}. 
\end{align} 


Observe that $Y\geq MPL \times H$, where $MPL$ stands in for the marginal product of labor, if the aggregate production function features decreasing or constant returns to scale. Under such a production function one can rewrite the last expression as
\begin{align}
\tau_{\iota}=1-\frac{wH}{Y}\geq 1-\frac{w H}{MPL \times H}
\end{align}
 Note further that the marginal product of labor exceeds the wage rate whenever the environmental tax is different from zero; compare the disucssion in subsection \ref{subsec:Rams}. It follows that the right-hand side is positive, hence
\begin{align}
\tau_{\iota}>0,
\end{align}
and the optimal tax scheme is progressive.
\end{proof}
