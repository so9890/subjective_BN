\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:con}
Some scholars argue that  reductive policies are necessary to handle environmental limits \citep{Schor2005SustainableReductionb, VanVuuren2018AlternativeTechnologies, Bertram2018TargetedScenarios}, and the question has been raised whether consumption is too high \citep{Arrow2004AreMuch}. On the other hand, the focus of environmental policy discussions in economics rests on corrective environmental taxation. In the light of tightening environmental limits \citep{Rockstrom2009AHumanity, IPCC2022}, I study whether labor income taxes - as a reductive policy tool - can help mitigate externalities. 

In the analytical part of the paper, I show in a simple model that labor income taxes are  progressive as part of the optimal environmental policy. %The model does not feature inequality.
% Quantitative results
% baseline model
When environmental tax revenues are not redistributed lump sum, labor supply is inefficiently high. Then, income taxes serve to diminish hours worked closer to the efficient level. The result prevails absent income inequality.


% quantitative
In the second part of the paper, I analyze in a quantitative model with skill heterogeneity and endogenous growth whether the optimal labor income tax remains progressive. Again, there are no equity concerns, but workers are perfectly ensured against income differences. 
The optimal income tax is progressive to reduce inefficiently high hours worked. The quantitative model reveals that income taxes also serve as a substitute for corrective taxes. Knowledge spillovers from the non-energy sector render environmental taxes especially costly. 
Fossil taxes make energy relatively more expensive which directs research from non-energy to energy sectors. As the non-energy sector features the most research processes it is especially important for aggregate technology and knowledge spillovers. Using income taxes instead of fossil taxes to lower emissions allows to direct more research to the non-energy sector and to profit from knowledge spillovers.
In sum, however, the reduction in labor supply outweighs the positive effect on growth and consumption decreases compared to a scenario where no income tax is used. 

In the quantitative setting, the income tax affects the economic structure through two channels. First, because the fossil sector is comparably labor intense, a reduction in labor supply favors the green sector. This mechanism makes a higher tax progressivity optimal. However, the effect vanishes in equilibrium due to endogenous growth.
Second, a skill-recomposition channel makes green energy production more costly compared to fossil production. This effect arises from a skill bias in the green sector and high-skill labor being more responsive to income taxation. 
The second channel dominates the recomposing effect of  income tax progressivity in equilibrium. A market size effect amplifies the skill-recomposition channel directing research to the fossil sector. 

%Initially, the intention not to harm growth too much makes a lower progressivity optimal. As growth in the fossil sector accelerates due to the dynamic structure of endogenous growth too low progressive income taxes conflict with meeting the emission limit. As a result, optimal progressivity increases over time.
%The optimal path of income tax progressivity is decreasing, a feature mainly driven by endogenous growth. As a result, the optimal income tax progressivity and the optimal fossil tax seem to behave like substitutes in the quantitative model. 

%Skill heterogeneity depresses optimal tax progressivity due to the adverse recomposing effect of a lower high-to-low skill labor supply on the green-to-fossil energy ratio. A higher corrective tax is required to meet emission limits when there is only one skill type: with only one skill the supply of fossil-specific inputs increases thereby violating the emission limit.

%% lump-sum transfers
%When environmental tax revenues are redistributed lump-sum, the motive to use labor income taxes to deal with inefficiently high labor supply vanishes. Instead, income taxes serve to boost growth as long as this does not conflict with meeting emission limits. Therefore, they are regressive. 
%\tr{not true! it is rather that the more in research is not worth it given the dynamics! and decreasing utility gains}
%However, the regressivity decreases since more labor supply causes more emissions especially the more progressed the technology. With only a labor income tax as a tool to raise growth, accelerating technology growth is not feasible as it is concomitant with more production and emissions. 

% extensions
In an extension, I am planning to give the Ramsey planner the opportunity to limit working hours directly. The literature advocating a reduction in consumption levels \citep[e.g.,][]{Schor2005SustainableReductionb} proposes a restriction of hours worked as policy instrument to lower the consumption of resources.
Even though advocated in the literature, there is evidence for political difficulties in reducing working hours. In 2020, the French Citizens' Convention on Climate voted against reducing working hours as a measure to handle climate change. Potentially, ignorance about economic consequences is an explanation. The extension would serve to better understand economic consequences.

\paragraph{Extension: What if the low skilled get a higher share \ar they reduce even less \ar more fossil input supply}

Redistribution to households with a higher marginal propensity to consume emissions counteracts the externality. This effect is amplified by a market size effect  of dirty goods.

% I plan to discuss results under counterfactual parameter values to elicit the robustness of the main result: the preference of progressive labour taxation above higher fossil taxes. 
%First, the productivity gap between sectors might be driving the results. Second, I will abstract from endogenous growth to learn about the labour-supply-innovation channel as a driver of the optimal policy. Finally, I plan to study how results change as returns to research are increasing within sector. 
%Due to the endogeneity of technological growth in the model, the reduction in work effort fosters less research especially in the non-energy sector.  %However, more hours worked in the Ramsey model fostering research would violate the emission target. As a result, growth in technology and in consumption is inefficiently low in order to meet the emission target. 

\begin{comment}
To shed more light on the main findings, I plan conduct several additional quantitative experiments. First, I want to reduce the size of the emission target, second, I allow for a longer time frame until net-zero emissions have to be reached. The IPCC report states that for a temperature target of 2Â°C net-zero emissions have to be reached by 2070 only. How does this laxer target affect the importance of labour income taxes. Given the wider time frame, the green sector might be able to catch up and growth could continue. Finally, how does a change in spillovers shape the result? % \textit{(Question: I guess that substitutability is key here! Growth in green implies growths in fossil when goods are no perfect substitutes! )}

%Another central aspect of the paper is the importance of inequality for the optimal environmental policy. How does household heterogeneity in labour supply shape the optimal environmental policy? First, I hypothesise that the skill bias of the green sector makes a less progressive income tax optimal. 
One main result of the paper is reduction of consumption and work effort as an optimal policy. So far, I have assumed that households are passive and preferences are fixed; there is no trade-off between environmental quality and consumption from a household perspective.
In an extension to the baseline model, I plan to depart from the representative agent assumption and explicitly model household heterogeneity. This setting allows to capture a change in household behaviour: A share of households is willing to voluntarily reduce consumption. I provide evidence for such behaviour using a representative Dutch dataset. More than 50\% of households are willing to reduce consumption in order to help the economy. Importantly, these households have a higher likelihood to work in the green sector. How does such a change in behaviour affect the optimal policy? Given the additional reduction in green-specific labour supply, the planner might find it optimal to set a more regressive tax to booster green production and research.    

\end{comment}

%However, data suggests, that households do care, and they express a willingness to reduce consumption.\footnote{\ The data I have studied comes from the Liss Panel, a representative sample of Dutch households, more than 50\% of participants indicate a readiness to change their behaviour to help the environment.} I want to study the effect of such behavioural  change on the optimal policy. Interestingly, households in high-skill jobs are more likely to declare their willingness to reduce. This linkage may intensify the trade-off between reduction and green labour supply. 


%1) BN and inequality
%2) preferences for labour
\begin{comment}
Preferences and the trade-off between leisure and consumption determining household behaviour seem to be key to the results. As argued by \cite{Boppart2019labourPerspectiveb}, the intensive margin of hours worked have been falling steadily over the last 130 years. They argue for the consistency of preferences which feature a slightly higher income effect than substitution effect. In the current model with log-utility and representative family framework,  the substitution effects offset each other. With the preferences suggested in \cite{Boppart2019labourPerspectiveb}, growth would affect hours worked, assumably changing the optimal policy. It could, for instance, be the case, that growth has to be slowed down even more, to prevent too high work efforts and consumption levels. % high-income, high-skill households might increase their labour supply with growth.

%Finally, endogenising growth constitutes another interesting trade-off when the impact of fiscal policy is skill specific. 
%As regards growth, it seems reasonable to consider growth as a change in the substitutability of dirty and clean goods in the final consumption good. As it stands now, growth in the dirty sector results in emission growth, ceteris paribus. Growth might instead be associated with a more efficient use of dirty energy sources, so that more output can be generated at lower emissions.
%
%Think about effects of government using revenues for other consumption. Then reducing demand will diminish demand for the final good. 
%Broadly speaking, there are two channels through which distortionary labour taxation affects emissions. First, by affecting households' labour supply decision (efficiency channel) and second in a mechanical way by changing households disposable income. The latter effect cancels out when tax revenues are used by the government to consume the final output good. Allowing the government to recycle revenues in a different way than for final good consumption uncloses another instrument to reduce emissions. 

%Further ideas for extensions: include behavioural aspects: a voluntary reduction in demand, and a lower disutility from working in the green sector.

\paragraph{Ways forward}
How to introduce compositional effects:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 	Utility function: With substitution and income effect not canceling (u(c)=$\frac{c^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma},\ \gamma\neq 1$), the wage rate might play a role, depends on GE effects.
	\item endogenising skill supply (rep agent chooses how much skill to supply, but this he already does... / might need to introduce structure as in HSV)
	\item government revenues are not used for final good consumption. Instead,  disposed of/ used for sth useful (this could be an extension and contribute to benefits of progressivity) THINK THIS ONLY CHANGES THE LEVEL TOO!
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Point 1 above}
change the utility function in the code to see what happens, if $\frac{Y_d}{Y_c}$ is constant in particular 
\paragraph{Point 3 above}
\textcolor{blue}{2) Government consumption wasted}
Letting the government not consume the final output good may alter the result. 
Now, the aggregate price level is determined endogenously as the goods market does not clear by Walras' law. 

In the equilibrium equations, I drop $p_t=1$ and use goods market clearing instead\\ $Y=c+\psi (x_c+x_d)$.
