\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{Motivation/ Real life setting}
Due to climate change and vital threats to biodiversity we need to reduce the consumption of resources. % why this?/ Resource consumption= to emissions??? 
Macroeconomic research has largely focused on a green \textit{recomposition} of consumption. However, doubt has been raised if recomposition alone suffices to fight climate change. An alternative and most likely complementary approach that has been proposed is a \textit{reduction} of economic output. %consumption levels. 
In light of the uncertainty about the success of a pure recomposition policy, it is time to ask: what are the effects of a reduction in economic output? 

\paragraph{Hypotheses/ why a macro model?}
More specifically, I am interested in the political conflicts which may arise from a reduction in economic output. For this purpose, there is heterogeneity on the household side. 
Households differ with respect to the sectors they are employed in and the ownership of capital. As a result, household income varies which again determines the emission-quality of the households consumption bundle.  


\paragraph{Qualitative versus quantitative model?}
A quantitative model would be needed if I was interested in numbers which I would want to compare to the data and take more seriously. 
I think I am more interested in understanding the conditions (parameter values etc.) under which a reduction is beneficial to the poor or to the rich. And also under what circumstances a reduction in output might be impeded by other mechanisms in lowering resource usage (endogenous innovation, general equilibrium effects through prices (and \textit{subjective} basic needs))


\paragraph{This paper/ results}
I use a general equilibrium framework in which the level of economic productivity is determined by demand. 

The focus rests on general equilibrium effects on the environmental externality and on the social acceptance of 


\paragraph{How to achieve a reduction in economic output?}
An essential contribution of the paper is to compare the effects of different policy measures to achieve a sufficient reduction in emissions.
