The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlights the need to transition to net-zero emissions by 2050 \citep{IPCC2022}. The question is what fiscal policy mix best supports this goal. The literature to date has largely focused on carbon taxes alone. Such taxes direct production and R\&D towards activities that pollute less \citep{Acemoglu2012TheChange}. However, other fiscal instruments also affect carbon emissions. Labor taxes, for example, curb the level of production generally. Conversely, labor subsidies may boost production. Such taxes may, thus, be an important part of the fiscal mix in achieving the  net-zero emission limit.

To analyze the optimal fiscal mix, I set up a model of directed technical change \citep{Acemoglu2002DirectedChange, Acemoglu2012TheChange}. The government chooses the dynamic path of labor income taxes and carbon taxes. Doing so, it anticipates that the net-zero emission limit will bind at some point in the future. Calibrating the model to the US economy, I can characterize the optimal fiscal mix during this transition and in the long term. The main finding is that when the net-zero emission limit binds, the optimal policy is to tax carbon heavily and to subsidize labor. During the transition phase, the optimal carbon tax is lower and a tax on labor reduces production. 

The key to the optimal mix of carbon and labor taxes are knowledge spillovers between research in conventional carbon-based and green industries. Decreasing returns to scale in research activity in each industry mean that a rapid shift in the composition of activity is socially costly. The labor tax allows the government to reduce emissions in the short run by  lowering production while–at the same time–engineering a smoother transition of economic activity across industries. In the long-run, only green production is feasible. A high carbon tax ensures this. Labor subsidies, in turn, serve to keep production and research activity high.

More in detail, the modeling follows \cite{Fried2018ClimateAnalysis}. A final consumption good is produced from energy and non-energy goods. The energy good, in turn, is composed of green and fossil energy. The fossil sector exerts emissions. Imperfectly monopolistic producers of machinery invest in research to increase the productivity of their machines. Machines are used in the intermediate sectors: non-energy, fossil, and green energy. Returns to research are decreasing in the number of researchers employed within a sector, and some knowledge spills over within sectors and across sectors.

Relative to the study by \cite{Fried2018ClimateAnalysis}, the current paper adds the consideration of an optimal policy. The optimal policy accounts for a gradually declining  net emission limit that eventually turns to zero in 2050. Where the literature  has mainly focused on carbon taxes \citep{Acemoglu2012TheChange, Fried2018ClimateAnalysis}, the planner chooses (i) a sales tax per unit of fossil energy (“the carbon tax”) and (ii) a tax on labor income in my model. The role for the labor income tax does not arise from equity considerations. Rather, the labor tax is an important instrument next to carbon taxes because it affects research activity and production.  I solve for the optimal path of carbon and labor taxes using the numerical approach by  \citep{Jones1993OptimalGrowth, Barrage2019OptimalPolicy}.

To highlight the importance of endogenous growth for the optimal fiscal mix, I start with a simple pencil-and-paper setting. This has the externality from fossil energy use but does away with endogenous growth. In this static setting, optimal fiscal policy only resorts to a Pigouvian carbon tax and lump-sum rebates. Labor taxes do not play a role.

Then, I turn to the dynamic setting with endogenous growth. I, first, calibrate the model to the US economy in the period from 2015 to 2019. Then, I feed into the model an exogenous emission limit based on the path of the global limit provided by the \cite{IPCC2022}. The emission limit for the US used in the analysis foresees a reduction by 84.5\% in net emissions relative to 2019-levels in 2020. The value increases to 85.6\% in 2045. In 2050, the emission limit further reduces to net zero. In this setting, I perform two quantitative exercises. First, I calculate the necessary carbon tax to meet the emission limit while keeping the labor income tax fixed. Second,  the planner optimally sets the carbon and the labor tax to maximize welfare.

As for the first exercise, I find that the necessary carbon tax equals US\$889 (in 2022 prices) per ton of carbon in the 2020-2024 period. The tax increases to US\$3,038 in the 2070-2074 period. The first value is approximately 4.4 times higher than the social costs of carbon recently calculated by the Resources for the Future institute and the University of Berkeley: US\$203.5 \citep{RFF}.\footnote{\  For comparability to my results, I transformed the RFF estimate of US\$185 in 2020 prices to 2022 prices. The RFF measure aims to capture the damage associated with a marginal increase in CO$_2$. It is not intended to implement a certain level of emissions. Abstracting from modeling and parameter uncertainty, the discrepancy suggests that focusing on the social costs of carbon alone would fail to implement the emission limits designed to meet the Paris Agreement. } 
The increase in the necessary tax on carbon follows from the tighter emission limit and market forces which direct inputs to the fossil sector, such as knowledge spillovers. I compare the necessary carbon tax in the calibrated model - which has a distortive income tax - to the necessary carbon tax absent labor income tax. Without income taxation, the required carbon tax is  7\% to 10\% higher.

As for the second exercise, I find that the emission limit is best implemented by a combination of carbon and labor income taxes. Before the net-zero emission limit binds, a positive tax on labor optimally accompanies a carbon tax. The carbon tax amounts to US\$987 in the 2020-2024 period. It increases steadily to US\$1,326 in 2045-2049. The average (income-weighted) marginal income tax rate equals 0.31\% in the 2020-2024 period and decreases to 0.01\% in the 2040-2044 period.

The motive for labor taxation follows from the effect of carbon taxes on the direction of research. In the initial years from 2020 to 2044, the government substitutes some of the carbon tax with a tax on labor. The smaller carbon tax allows for more research in the fossil sector. Decreasing returns to research make a more equal allocation of scientists across sectors more productive. Technological advances in the fossil sector, in turn, benefit green growth in future periods because of knowledge spillovers.

The optimal policy mix changes sharply once the net-zero emission limit has to be implemented. Now, the carbon tax rises steeply to discourage further research and production in the fossil sector. The optimal tax on carbon jumps to US\$2,833 per ton in 2050 and gradually increases to US\$3,186 in the 2070-2074 period. In addition, the government subsidizes labor. The subsidy stabilizes production and incentivizes R\&D investment as more workers stand ready to use machines. The labor income tax becomes negative already in 2045-2049: the average marginal tax rate is -0.07\%. It declines to -0.16\% in 2070-2074. The more stringent emission limit makes it infeasible to continue to benefit from more research in the fossil sector. Instead, fossil research has to be reduced intensely to meet the net-zero emission limit.

Knowledge spillovers crucially affect the optimal policy. On the one hand, spillovers to the fossil sector decrease the effectiveness of the carbon tax because green growth makes research in the fossil sector more productive. The optimal carbon tax to meet the emission limit, therefore, increases when knowledge spills across sectors relative to a benchmark without knowledge spillovers. Furthermore, the optimal carbon tax rises over time to counter growing productivity in the fossil sector. 

On the other hand, knowledge spillovers to the green sector enable the economy to profit from fossil growth in early periods as green growth follows suit. A more productive green sector renders a transition to net-zero emissions in future periods less costly. As discussed above, more fossil growth today is implemented by a smaller carbon tax combined with a tax on labor. In contrast, absent knowledge spillovers, the optimal policy consists of a carbon tax and a subsidy on labor in all periods. In this case, meeting the emission limit in later years would become too costly if fossil growth today was higher. Therefore, more research should be allocated to the green sector already in initial periods.
