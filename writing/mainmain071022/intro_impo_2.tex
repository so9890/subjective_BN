\section{Introduction}

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlights the need to transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. The literature has by and large focused on carbon taxes to mitigate environmental pollution. Carbon taxes direct demand towards less polluting goods. When knowledge accumulation is endogenous, the carbon tax also shifts research across sectors. A labor income tax, in contrast, affects the level of emissions by diminishing work effort. When a labor income tax is available, the carbon tax can be targeted more towards directing research. 
What is the optimal fiscal mix to implement the emission limit?

I answer this question in a model of directed technical change. The government chooses labor income taxes and a carbon tax. Carbon tax revenues are rebated lump sum. Results show that the optimal policy mix consists of a carbon tax in combination with a tax on labor in early years. This policy enables the economy to profit from growth in the fossil sector while the tax on labor reduces work effort to meet the emission limit. When the net-zero emission limit binds, the economy has to reduce fossil research more. The optimal carbon tax rises. A subsidy on labor stabilizes output. 

The role of labor income taxes arises from the contracting effect of lump-sum rebates. 
When the carbon tax is also targeted at directing research, carbon tax revenues and hence lump-sum transfers change, too. When, for instance, the carbon tax is set lower in order not to reduce fossil research too much, lump-sum transfers decline. This stimulates economic activity as households are eager to work more. As a result, production and thereby emissions increase. To counter this effect, the government taxes labor. Absent a labor income tax, a reduction in the carbon tax to foster fossil research would conflict with the emission limit.

The paper separates into two parts. First, I propose a simple model without growth to highlight the role of lump-sum rebates of carbon tax revenues. There are two intermediate sectors of production, one of which induces a negative environmental externality. The environmental externality is the only distortion motivating government action. In the model, a Ramsey planner seeks to maximize welfare of a representative agent having  an environmental and a labor income tax at her disposal. In a stylized version of the model, when no lump-sum transfers are available, it is optimal to tax labor to contract economic activity. When lump-sum rebates are available, however, there is no role for labor income taxes in the exogenous growth model. 

Second, I introduce endogenous growth into the model. The resulting model builds on \cite{Fried2018ClimateAnalysis}. The model features three sectors producing intermediate goods:  a non-energy good, fossil energy, and green energy. The latter two are used to produce energy which again is combined with the non-energy good to produce the final consumption good. The fossil sector exerts emissions. Within each intermediate sector of production, imperfectly monopolistic machine producers demand research to increase productivity of their machines and augment profits.

The evolution of research features a \textit{building-on-the-shoulders-of-giants} mechanism: last period's technology level positively affects today's level. This introduces dynamics and an inefficiency into the model because machine producers do not internalize future profits in today's investment decision. Knowledge spillovers across sectors are another source of inefficiency. To allow the planner to reduce growth, I endogenize the supply of scientists contrary to the literature \citep{Acemoglu2012TheChange, Fried2018ClimateAnalysis}. 

In the optimal policy analysis, the government cares about the externality due to an exogenous constraint on emissions. This approach has the advantage of reducing modeling and parametric uncertainty. The uncertainty surrounds (i) the relation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate warming and (ii) the impact of the change in climate on well-being and production. I use estimated emission limits stemming from meta studies of complex integrated assessment models provided by the \cite{IPCC2022}. Since these limits are designed to meet climate targets, they are highly politically relevant.  

%//Quantitative Exercises//
I perform the following quantitative exercises. First, in a policy experiment, I calculate the necessary carbon tax to meet the emission limit. Second, in an optimal policy analysis, the planner sets the environmental tax and chooses whether to tax or subsidize labor.


%//Findings/Mechanism//

Main finding
In the first exercise, I find that the necessary tax equals US\$937 (in 2022 prices) in the 2020-2025 period and increases to US\$3,173 in the 2070-2075 period. The first value is approximately 5 times as high as the social costs of carbon recently calculated by the Resources for the Future institute and the University of Berkeley: US\$185 \citep{RFF}. Using a non-distortive income tax instead of an income tax scheme resembling the progressivity of the US tax scheme \citep[taken from][]{Heathcote2017OptimalFramework},  the required carbon tax increases by between 7\% and 10\%. 


The optimal policy mix accompanying the transition to net-zero emissions is to tax carbon and to tax labor in the years from 2020 to 2040 before the net-zero emission limit binds. Then, the optimal policy mix contains a subsidy on labor. The motive for labor taxation follows from the effect of carbon taxes on the direction of research. In early years, when the emission limit is less strict, the government substitutes some of the carbon tax with a tax on labor. The smaller carbon tax allows for more research in the fossil sector which is especially beneficial for consumption growth as (i) the fossil sector is technologically more advanced\footnote{\citep{Acemoglu2012TheChange} show that in this case the periods necessary for the economy to grow at the same rate as without policy intervention are increasing in the productivity gap. Simply because more growth in the green sector is required  to catch up with the technology level in the fossil sector.}, and (ii) decreasing returns to research make a more equal allocation of scientists across sectors more productive. 
When the net-zero emission limit binds from 2050 onward, a higher carbon tax discourages research in the fossil sector. In order to stabilize production, the higher carbon tax is combined with a subsidy on labor. 
Once the carbon tax not only targets energy producers’ demand for fossil energy, but also research, this has a stimulating or contracting side effect on labor supply through the government’s budget constraint.  When the government sets a lower carbon tax in order not to dampen fossil research as much, lump-sum rebates decline stimulating labor supply and economic activity. Yet, the rise in output would violate the emission limit, and a tax on labor serves to counter the rise in labor supply. In contrast, when a higher carbon tax is needed to diminish fossil research, lump-sum transfers increase, and labor supply reduces. To stabilize output, it becomes optimal to subsidize labor. 

Knowledge spillovers crucially affect the optimal policy.  On the one hand, knowledge spillovers to the fossil sector decrease the effectiveness of the carbon tax. Growth in other sectors drags growth in the fossil sector. On the other hand, knowledge spillovers from the fossil to other sectors mitigate the costs of more fossil growth by fostering green technology growth. 
Overall, the optimal carbon tax to meet the emission limit increases with knowledge spillovers. But, knowledge spillovers enable to profit from fossil growth in early periods as green growth follows suit.  As discussed above, more fossil growth today is implemented by a smaller carbon tax combined with a tax on labor. 
In contrast, absent knowledge spillovers, the optimal policy consists of a carbon tax and a subsidy on labor. In this case, the value of fossil research is smaller as the green sector does not benefit from fossil research and more research should be allocated to the green sector directly. Therefore, the labor income serves to mitigate the contractionary effect of higher lump-sum rebates. 

\begin{comment}
The less sector-specific knowledge is, the more should the government tax carbon to prevent the fossil sector from growing too much through spillovers from other sectors. The optimal carbon tax increases over time since knowledge spillovers from other sectors drag research to the fossil sector countering the effect of the carbon tax to make fossil energy more expensive. 
On the other hand, knowledge spillovers from the fossil sector allow the economy to profit from fossil research in early years while meeting the net-zero emission limit later on. Then, the green sector grows fast enough to mitigate the costs of meeting the net-zero emission limit in later years albeit more research is allocated to the fossil sector. 

Importance of fossil research 
Research in the fossil sector is especially important to consumption growth for two reasons. First, the fossil sector is the more productive one compared to green energy. \citep{Acemoglu2012TheChange} show that in this case the periods necessary for the economy to grow at the same rate as without policy intervention are increasing in the productivity gap. Simply because more growth in the green sector is required  to catch up with the technology level in the fossil sector. Second, the model features decreasing returns to research within a sector. When all scientists were allocated to one sector, it would be growth enhancing to reallocate some scientists to other sectors to equalize the returns to research. To meet the emission limit, the economy has to bear these costs.
