		What is the optimal mix of  carbon and labor income taxes in a transition toward net-zero emissions? I build a model of directed technical change in which an emission limit renders the  use of fossil energy  socially costly. In the long run, when the net-zero emission limit is binding, an optimal policy makes extensive use of carbon taxes. A subsidy on labor helps stabilize production. In the short run, the policy implications differ sharply. Labor is taxed  to reduce economic activity and emissions. The carbon tax, instead, should not rise as steeply. This allows the economy to benefit from fossil research while knowledge spillovers from the fossil to the green sector mitigate the costs of a green transition.
			
			
			% NOTE: not sure if it is spillovers which drive higher green growth tomorrow or the more aggressive policy in the future.
