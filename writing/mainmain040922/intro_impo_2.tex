\begin{comment}
When labor supply is fixed, environmental taxes alone can establish the efficient allocation in a representative agent economy absent fiscal distortions. Then, such a tax instrument is optimally set to the social cost of an externality, and originators internalize these social costs: the Pigou principle.
However, not redistributing environmental tax revenues reduces consumption below the efficient level and, as I demonstrate, the optimal environmental tax does not follow the Pigou principle.  If, on top, the  labor supply decision is endogenous, the environmental tax alone features too high labor supply. \tr{This results in too high environmental externality. \textbf{To be shown!}}

Lump-sum transfers of environmental tax revenues restore the efficient allocation: as households become richer, labor supply reduces. When lump-sum transfers are not available, the government can establish the efficient allocation by redistributing environmental tax revenues through an income tax scheme which I demonstrate to be progressive.

%\subsubsection*{First part: Analytic stuff}
%\paragraph{simple model}
To derive the theoretical results, I propose a simple and general model. There are two intermediate sectors of production, one of which induces a negative environmental externality. The environmental externality is the only distortion motivating government action. In the model, a Ramsey planner seeks to maximize welfare of a representative agent having  an environmental and a labor income tax at her disposal. The income tax scheme is generally non-linear and a common specification in the public finance literature \citep[e.g.][]{Benabou2002TaxEfficiency, Heathcote2017OptimalFramework}.
The model abstracts from  endogenous growth, inequality, and an exogenous government revenue condition. The last two are important abstractions since they traditionally motivate income taxation.

%\paragraph{Analytic findings 1}
%\textbf{MAIN finding: Progressive income tax} 
I show that the optimal labor income tax is progressive when no lump-sum transfers are available. 
The optimality of progressive income taxes results from inefficiently high labor supply. The mechanism is simple: when labor income taxes are not redistributed lump sum, a wedge between households' shadow value of labor income and the social one emerges.  As a result, labor supply is too high. 
This is a novel motive for income taxation.
%Following this intuition, environmental and labor income taxes complement each other in the optimal environmental policy absent lump-sum rebates. The higher environmental tax revenues, the higher the distortion in households' income and output. 
% I argue that environmental and income taxes are complements. The first is targeted at the environmental externality while the second serves to mitigate distortions in the labor market resulting from environmental taxation.
  
%\paragraph{Analytic findings 2}
%\textbf{Pigou principle violated absent lump-sum transfers and efficient allocation not feasible}
I consider two cases how environmental tax revenues are recycled. First, revenues are consumed by the government, and, second, the government redistributes revenues via the income tax scheme. In both cases the government can use a non-linear income tax scheme. In the first scenario, I find that the optimal environmental tax does not satisfy the Pigou principle: the corrective tax does not necessarily equal the social cost of the externality. %As demonstrated by \textit{Pigou xxx}, setting the environmental tax equal to the marginal costs arising from the polluting activity that are not private (the so-called social cost) is optimal. The idea is that polluters behave as if internalizing the social cost of their action when confronted with the environmental tax. I show that when environmental tax revenues are consumed by the government, the Pigou principle is violated. 
In this case, the motive to increase private consumption by lowering environmental tax revenues makes a deviation of the environmental tax from the social cost of the externality optimal.
Furthermore, when labor supply is elastic, non-redistribution of environmental tax revenues results in inefficiently high hours worked. Then, the optimal labor tax is progressive to diminish work effort closer to the efficient level.
Nevertheless, the efficient allocation is not feasible under this policy regime since either consumption is inefficiently low or work effort is too high. 

%
%\paragraph{Analytic findings 3}
%\textbf{Efficient allocation can be implemented through redistribution via income tax scheme}
%The inefficiency of the optimal allocation when environmental tax revenues are consumed by the government motivates to point to a 
In the second scenario, the Ramsey planner redistributes environmental tax revenues through the income tax scheme; now, the efficient allocation is attainable. The optimal income tax scheme is again progressive. By redistributing environmental tax revenues, consumption can be chosen efficiently high while the labor income tax scheme handles too high labor supply. In fact, redistribution via the income tax scheme incentivizes more labor supply. A progressive income tax scheme counteracts this tendency restoring the efficient level of hours worked. 
In this setting, the Pigou principle holds because there is no trade-off between lowering the externality and consumption.
%More precisely, I study the optimal policy mix of environmental and labor income taxes to meet emission limits. 
%I find that progressive labor income taxes are used in concert with fossil taxes to optimally reduce emissions. 
% First, I propose a tractable model to provide intuition for this result: Non-lump-sum redistribution of environmental tax revenues increase the gains from labor. Leisure becomes more expensive and households do not reduce their labor supply efficiently in response to the fossil tax. To reduce hours to the efficient level, income taxes complement the fossil tax to lower hours to the efficient level.  
% 
% 
% 
%Second, I assess the importance of this novel role for income taxes in a quantitative endogenous growth model:
%Even though a more progressive tax reduces research effort  and recomposes production towards the fossil sector, the optimal tax is progressive. 


%\subsubsection*{Quantitative exercise}
%In this and the subsequent two paragraphs, I motivate the quantitative exercise and expound the model.
%Even though I have shown theoretically that progressive income taxes form one pillar of the optimal environmental policy when environmental tax revenues are not redistributed lump sum, it is not clear whether progressivity remains optimal in a more realistic, quantitative model. 
%Two countering mechanisms of tax progressivity shall be considered here.
% relation to core model and to fried;

 I extend the core model studied in the analytical section by adding endogenous growth, a non-energy sector, and skill heterogeneity to investigate the optimal income tax progressivity in a more realistic setting. The resulting model builds on \cite{Fried2018ClimateAnalysis}. It enhances aforementioned work by an optimal policy analysis, the availability of income taxes, and skill heterogeneity. 
% no income inequality: trade off as in classical 
I maintain the assumption of a representative family which, however, consists of two skill types. Within the family, workers are perfectly insured against income differentials so that equity concerns do not drive the optimal policy. The trade-off shaping the optimal policy stays within the boundaries of traditional environmental policy considerations: consumption versus externality mitigation.\footnote{\ Several papers cover the question whether a reduction or end to growth can be optimal due to environmental concerns \citep[for example,][]{Stokey1998AreGrowth, Acemoglu2012TheChange, Jones2016LifeGrowth}.}
To allow the planner to reduce growth, I endogenize the supply of scientists contrary to the literature \citep{Acemoglu2012TheChange, Fried2018ClimateAnalysis}. %Scientists are part of the representative household
 %  This modeling choice allows to focus the analysis on environmental externality aspects which shape the optimal tax progressivity from an environmental perspective.

The model features three sectors producing intermediate goods:  a non-energy, a fossil energy, and a green energy good. The latter two are used to produce an energy good which again is combined with the non-energy good to produce the final consumption good.
Within each intermediate sector of production, imperfectly monopolistic machine producers demand research to increase productivity of their machines and augment profits. 

The evolution of research features a \textit{building-on-the-shoulders-of-giants} mechanism: last periods technology level positively affects today's level. This introduces dynamics and an inefficiency into the model because machine producers do not internalize future profits in today's investment decision. 
Knowledge spillovers across sectors are another source of inefficiency. The income tax scheme affects the level and the direction of research by impacting the returns to research.
As demonstrated by \cite{Acemoglu2002DirectedChange},
the returns to research are shaped by two effects. First, they increase with the size of the sector: a market size effect. Therefore, a higher labor supply may incentivize R\&D investment. In addition, a good's relative price raises sector-specific returns to research: a price effect. 


% This price effect becomes relevant when zooming in on the recomposing effect of labor income taxation, which I will consider next.
%Endogenous growth could make a more regressive income tax optimal to incentivize innovation. The size of the market for  innovation may positively affect the profitability of research investment in general. % level effect

In the model, high-skill labor is scarce which explains a skill premium in equilibrium. Consequently, these workers supply more hours and are more responsive to the substitution effect when income tax progressivity makes leisure cheaper.
The green sector of production requires a higher share of high-skill labor. This skill-bias combined with the more responsive high-skill supply to income taxation introduces a recomposing effect of labor income taxes: as the tax scheme becomes more progressive, supply of the green-specific input good reduces relatively more, a \textit{skill-composition} channel.
%Progressive income taxes lower emissions by enhancing supply of the green sector-specific input good.  Then, the economy transitions to a higher dirty production share. 

Due to the higher labor share in fossil relative to green energy production \citep{Fried2018ClimateAnalysis}, a countering recomposing mechanism emerges: a \textit{labor-share} channel. As labor supply declines, production of the less labor intense good becomes cheaper and the energy mix greener. Similarly, the non-energy good is more labor intense than the energy good resulting in a higher energy share in final production. 

	\begin{comment}

Directed technical change amplifies or mitigates this recomposing effect of the income tax. The market size effect renders research in the sector with the larger input market more profitable, whereas the price effect increases demand for scientists in the sector with the relatively scarcer good. Since the two energy goods are substitutes, previous research suggests that the market effect dominates and research is directed towards the sector with the bigger input market, that is, the fossil sector. 
As regards final good production, energy and non-energy goods are complements so that the price effect is expected to dominate and the recomposition towards high-skill supply should boost research in energy goods relative to non-energy goods.\footnote{\ For a discussion of these two mechanisms compare \cite{Acemoglu2002DirectedChange, Loebbing2019NationalChange, Hemous2021DirectedEconomics}.

	\end{comment}


%\footnote{\ As the model is composed of three sectors in which research takes place, the green, fossil, and non-energy sector, there are two channels through which relative skill supply may affect the direction of research. First, the green sector is comparably more high-skill intense than the fossil sector. Since the two goods are substitutes, previous research suggests that the market effect dominates and research is directed towards the sector with the bigger input market , that is the fossil sector. In addition, the non-energy labor input good is in higher supply than the energy-specific labor good. However, since energy and non-energy goods are complements, the price effect is expected to dominate and the recomposition towards high-skill supply should boost research in energy goods relative to non-energy goods.  Both channels foster emissions. }



%\paragraph{How the externality is modeled}
In the quantitative model, I focus on the policy regime where environmental tax revenues are consumed by the government.
Current debates on how to optimally use environmental tax revenues in politics \citep{Baker2017TheDividends} and academia \citep[e.g.][]{Fried2018TheGenerations, Carattini2018} motivate to focus on this policy regime. 
 The government cares about the externality due to an exogenous constraint on emissions. This approach, known as a cost-effectiveness approach, has the advantage of reducing modeling and parametric uncertainty. The uncertainty surrounds (1) the relation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate warming and (2) the impact of the change in climate on well-being and production. I  use estimated emission limits stemming from meta studies of complex integrated assessment models provided by the \cite{IPCC2022}. Since these limits are designed to meet climate targets, they are highly politically relevant.  
% think about the relation of an absolute emission target and not reducing hours
Given these absolute emission limits, allowing for endogenous growth is important to take seriously the possibility of green growth to reduce the costs of environmental policies. % Endogenous growth introduces dynamics into the model since today's level of technology positively depends on yesterday's technology: a \textit{standing on the shoulder of giants} mechanism.  


%The model differentiates between high- and low-skill labor to account for a skill bias found for the green sector \citep{Consoli2016DoCapital}. This asymmetry of sectors renders regressive taxes a tool to lower relative production costs in the green sector: high-skill workers reduce their labor supply more in response to a more progressive tax as leisure is more valuable to them. This recomposing mechanism counteracts intentions to lower emissions. %, a regressive tax functions as a green subsidy. % In fact, there is an externality arising from high-skill labor supply as it shapes the share of fossil to green energy production. 
%On the other hand, progressive income taxes lower aggregate production by diminishing the price of leisure. 
%Endogenous growth amplifies the repercussions of progressive income taxes:
%First, a lower labor supply reduces the profitability of research in general. By reducing hours worked the planner sacrifices technological progress. Secondly, the recomposing effect is aggravated as research is directed towards the sector with the increased labor share, i.e. the fossil sector.

%\paragraph{Calibration}
The model is calibrated to the US in the baseline period from 2015 to 2019. I proceed in two steps. First, I set certain parameters to values found in the literature. Most importantly, I use reasonable values of production and innovation processes found in \cite{Fried2018ClimateAnalysis}. % who conducts a rigorous calibration exercise. 
With these parameter values at hand, I match the share of high skill in the green and non-green sectors building on \cite{Consoli2016DoCapital}. The emission target is set to the values suggested in the Sixth Assessment Report of the \cite{IPCC2022} on mitigation pathways: a 50\% reduction during the 2030s relative to 2019 levels and  net-zero emissions from 2050 onward; the remaining carbon budget pins down a limit on emissions in the 2020s.

%\paragraph{Quantitative exercise}
I perform the following quantitative exercises. 
 The planner sets the environmental tax and the progressivity parameter of the non-linear income tax scheme to maximize welfare while satisfying the emission limit. %Environmental tax revenues are consumed by the government. %As discussed in the analytical section, under this policy regime the efficient allocation is not feasible, but, it is  more policy relevant. 
%I am taking a political economy perspective on the maximization problem
I solve the Ramsey model explicitly for 55 years starting from 2020.\footnote{\ Following \cite{Kotlikoff2021MakingWin}, a household is economically active for 55 years. } The presented analysis does not seek to solve an infinite-horizon problem. The focus on utility of households living during the transition period is legitimate given their importance for political feasibility.
%\citep[compare][]{Fried2018TheGenerations}.
However, absent a value assigned to periods beyond 2075, the optimal allocation features decreasing innovation inputs as future gains from innovation are not policy relevant.
Yet, there exist political tendencies to take into account future populations:  the \cite{UNSUS} formulated a sustainable development criterion stressing care for future generations regarding environmental and economic needs. 
Therefore, I derive a continuation value to approximate the value of innovation for the future.\footnote{\ This approach enables me to mitigate end-point problems in a dynamic setting, while, at the same time, I do not have to assume the existence of a balanced growth path. 
 In other studies investigating dynamic policies \citep{Jones1993OptimalGrowth, Barrage2019OptimalPolicy}, %\cite{Jones1993OptimalGrowth} assume (p.487) \textit{ In all these exercises, we assume that both solutions to the planner's problems exist (in particular, the feasible set of policy plans is non- empty) and that the time paths of these solutions converge to steady- state growth paths}.}
a continuation value is added to the planner's problem which typically relies on balanced growth assumptions with constant ratios and policies; such assumptions seem unjustified  in the present economy.
Under the premise that taxes remain fixed, market forces most likely violate the emission limit given the structure of the model. }
%\textit{ also look at \cite{Conesa2009TaxingAll} who make some argument about bgp preferences: to allow for a broader set of parameters, they abstract from growth}
%Furthermore, as the emission limit is absolute, an ever increasing technology level (which is the case under decreasing returns to research), the use of fossil labor and machines has to decline towards zero.

% Instead, I constrain the planner to focus on the 60 year period during which the economy needs to transition to the zero-emission target. To make the planner care about future periods, I adopt a sustainability-type of condition: the potential to grow in terms of technology has to be at least as high as today.\footnote{\ Absent this condition, technological progress today is less valuable. The value of the technology level for future periods - due to the dynamic structure of innovation - is not taken into account. } 
% What is left to future generations in terms of production has some lower bound. 
% The productive asset inherited from predecessors is the technology level in the present model. 
 

  


% The planner is constrained by a sustainability motive to leave at least as much resources to future periods than for the explicitly modeled periods.\footnote{\ \tr{To be done}}
%This approach has the advantage of not having to assume the existence of a balanced growth path. Given that one factor of production, fossil energy, is bounded by an exogenous limit, I seek to stay agnostic on this aspect.
%\tr{\textit{Alternative: assume the economy reaches a BGP in some future period; all variables grow at constant rates. Possible?}}

% main finding; then understand why; what are the drivers: how does the result change as things are added or taken from the model
%\paragraph{Findings}
%\textbf{Progressive income tax}
The quantitative findings confirm optimality of progressive income taxes. 
Labor income taxes mainly serve to lower inefficiently high labor supply as studied in the analytical section.
Over time, progressivity shrinks: because the tighter emission limit makes consumption more valuable, the planner chooses an increasing path for hours worked. The reduction in overall production through progressive income taxes, in turn, allows to meet emission limits at lower corrective tax rates. 

The model suggests the use of labor income taxes as substitutes for environmental taxes. Meeting emission limits by bluntly reducing overall production through labor income taxes allows to profit from knowledge spillovers from the non-energy sector. As the non-energy sector is the biggest sector in terms of research processes, it affects aggregate technology growth most thereby boosting knowledge spillovers. 
The rise in non-energy research is driven by the lower fossil tax. A reduction in the price of energy makes non-energy goods relatively more expensive. The price effect directs research to the non-energy sector. This alleviates the reduction in consumption growth. 
Yet, exploitation of this mechanism is limited in size and scope. Once the net-zero emission limit binds, corrective taxes can only be reduced slightly when the income tax is progressive, and consumption growth is similar to the scenario without income tax. %Overall, the results suggest a rather clear cut between responsibilities of policy instruments, since the environmental tax remains largely unchanged irrespective of whether an income tax is used. 

The recomposing effect of the progressive income tax favors more fossil production in equilibrium. 
 The labor-share channel vanishes from the model once growth is endogenous so that the skill-composition channel prevails. A market-size effect directs research towards the fossil sector in response to a relatively higher supply of low-skill labor. Yet,  the response in the direction of innovation is small as price adjustments almost fully absorb the recomposition in skills, a finding due to the endogenous supply of researchers.

% emerging from endogenous growth.Since the fossil sector is the most technologically advanced, it boosts growth in the other sectors through knowledge spillovers. This renders fossil taxes especially costly. Lowering production levels through the income tax, instead, allows to profit from knowledge spillovers. In this channel, environmental and income taxes are substitutes. 
 %The environmental tax targets the externality, whereas the income tax handles the inefficiency arising from environmental tax revenues. 
%When depriving the government from an income tax scheme, the optimal fossil tax is higher in all time periods. %Once an income tax is available to handle inefficiently high hours worked, a lower environmental tax is required to handle emission limits. 
%The tax progressivity comes at the costs of lower consumption and an adverse green-to-fossil energy ratio.

% despite its repercussions on growth and emissions. Indeed, this policy increases the share of fossil to green energy and reduces research efforts and consumption. %As the emission limit becomes tighter over time, the Ramsey planner augments both the environmental tax and income tax progressivity. 
%In general, income tax progressivity and the environmental tax appear to be complements: as the emission limit becomes tighter, the two increase. Yet, with introduction of the net-zero emission limit, income tax progressivity decreases on impact. 
%The positive correlation between income tax progressivity and the environmental tax is in line with the analytical finding.

% complements


% importance of endogenous growth
To shed light on the role of endogenous growth and skill heterogeneity on the optimal policy, I run the analysis in modified models simplifying in turn and separately on each dimension. 
Both endogenous growth and skill heterogeneity make income tax progressivity more costly: abstracting from either ingredient leads to a higher optimal tax progressivity. 
%Endogenous growth accounts for the relatively quick decrease in labor tax progressivity. 
When growth is exogenous, the advantageous labor-share channel is more pronounced so that a progressive tax implies a higher green-energy share. The corrective tax is higher in the exogenous growth model since there is no market-driven amplification of environmental policies \citep[a finding stressed in ][]{Fried2018ClimateAnalysis}. 

When there is only one type of skill, the optimal policy achieves a labor supply close to the efficient one by use of a more progressive income tax. Intuitively, the planner faces no trade-off between too low a reduction in low-skill and too-high a reduction in high-skill hours.
The environmental tax required to meet emission limits in the model with homogeneous skill is higher. A level effect on fossil production  explains this result: compared to the heterogeneous skill model, fossil-specific labor is in higher supply.% This highlights the priority of corrective taxes to reduce emissions. 

%The reason is that more research effort loses in value as consumption increases. As dynamic spill overs of the research process advance, an additional unit of research effort is not compensated by enough from more consumption. \textit{\tr{This might be due to the missing continuation value! }}

%To understand this finding, it is informative to look at a setting with lump-sum transfers. Then, the motive to use lump-sum taxes to reduce labor supply vanishes. The labor tax can, however, be used to boost growth through a market-size mechanism by enhancing labor supply. Indeed, in such a setting the optimal labor income tax is progressive. Yet, regressivity reduces similar to the result without lump-sum transfers. The reason for this gradual increase is that in  the emission limit prevents the usage of labor income taxes to boost growth.
%More labor supply causes more emissions especially the more progressed the technology. With only a labor income tax as a tool to raise growth, accelerating technology growth issions. Indeed, this policy increases the share of fossil to green energy and reduces research efforts and consumption. %As the emission limit becomes tighter over time, the Ramsey planner augments both the environmental tax and income tax progressivity. 
%In general, income tax progressivity ands not feasible as it is concomitant with more production and emissions.
