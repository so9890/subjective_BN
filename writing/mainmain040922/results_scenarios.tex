\subsection{Results }
This section depicts the environmental tax which is required to meet the emission limits and the evolution of key variables under distinct policy regimes. The income tax scheme is kept fixed at its calibrated levels: $\tau_{\iota t}=0.181$, $\lambda=0.43$.
I consider the following regimes: first, environmental tax revenues are redistributed lump sum to households. Second, the government runs a consolidated budget and environmental tax revenues are redistributed via the income tax scheme; that is, $\lambda$ adjusts. Third, environmental tax revenues are recycled as subsidies to the green sector. Fourth, the government consumes environmental tax revenues.
