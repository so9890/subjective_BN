	\item<+-| alert@+> due to climate change, we need to reduce the consumption of resources
	\vspace{4mm}
	\item<+-| alert@+> macroeconomic research largely focuses on a green \textbf{\textcolor{cyan!100}{recomposition}} of consumption 
\vspace{4mm}
	\item<+-| alert@+>  but it is unclear whether recomposition alone is sufficient to fight climate change at today's high consumption levels% some non-green production methods remain....
	%	\item<+-| alert@+> green production can meet today's high consumption levels
	%\end{enumerate}
	% the two are basically the same: some non-green technologies would remain to meet todays high levels of consumption. Or consumption has to reduce to make the recomposition sufficient

	\item[\ar]<+-| alert@+>  this project focuses on a \textbf{\textcolor{cyan!100}{reduction}}  of consumption % you might believe that a recomposition is enough given market mechanisms to foster new innovations, however, it could be the case that it is not possible => better be prepared!

		\begin{block}{Research Question}
			What are the effects of a reduction in consumption?% on societal acceptance? % on inequality and macro variables?% by consumers? What would policymakers choose?\\ or\\
%What is the socially optimal policy to achieve a sufficient reduction in aggregate consumption?
	\end{block}
%\textbf{With a focus on}:
%- political economy and societal acceptance (profits and labour income)\\
%- environmental externality \small{(indirect effects through innovations, unemployment, a recomposition of demand)}
%
\pause
\textbf{Model}
\pause
\vspace{-2mm}
	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
		%\item neoclassical growth model: output and consumption determined by factor supply
		\item \textbf{demand-determined production level} allowing for excess supply of labour \\
		\small{(building on models of economic slack, such as \cite{Auerbach2021InequalityEconomy})}
		
		\item sectors differ with respect to the degree of resource usage % calibrated so that only producing with the low sector does not meet initial consumption levels	
		\item \textbf{Inequality}: Households differ with respect to
		\begin{itemize}
	
\item the sector where they are employed in
\item the composition and environmental cost of their consumption bundle due to\\ \textbf{basic needs} 
\item firm ownership
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{directed innovations}, cost of non-green capital stock, dynamic model
	\end{itemize}
\vspace{2mm}
\pause 
\begin{block}{Focus of this paper}
(1) indirect effects on climate externality  and (2) societal acceptance of such a policy
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How to model a reduction of consumption?}
	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
		\item intrinsic change in household preferences \textbf{?}
		\item policy 
		\begin{itemize}
				\item reduction of working time as suggested by \cite{GoughCANGREEN} (non-separable utility)
				\item foster and establish easy ways to share durable consumption
				\item economic-ecological education (long-run policy)
			%	\item tax on consumption beyond needs or high-emission consumption 
	\item empirically study/ draw from literature studying relation of ecological cost of consumption bundles and household characteristics/ events 
		
	\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\pause
\textbf{Exercise and Goal}
\begin{itemize}
\item compare effects of different policies to reduce aggregate consumption as to limit global warming to 1.5 Â°C above pre-industrial levels (accounting for indirect effects)
%\item  study the  political economy of consumption reduction (implementability, societal acceptance)
	\item shed light on  societal acceptance/ optimal implementation of reduction 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Why a quantitative model?}
	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
		\setbeamercolor{alerted text}{fg=black} %change the font color
	%	\setbeamerfont{alerted text}{series=\bfseries} 
		
		\item Does a reduction in demand slow down green innovation? Or does a triggered recomposition imply an acceleration?
		\item If the poor get poorer, do
		 they adjust their composition of consumption  in a way that emissions increase?
		\item Who profits, who loses?  Does such a policy increase inequality? For example, because the poor see a lower labour income, or do profits sink in a ways so that inequality decreases?
	%	\item various mechanisms shape the effect of a reduction in consumption. Characterised by different income sources, inequality will be affected 
%\item ambiguous effect on climate externality: e.g. reduction of demand for high-emission goods \ar high-emission sectors lay off workers \ar increase in inequality if low-income households work primarily in these sectors \ar with motivation to meet basic needs those households revert to consume more emission-high goods in case they are cheaper
%\item effect on directed innovation unclear: lower demand \ar less innovations? 
%\item rebound effect?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Data}
	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]\setbeamercolor{alerted text}{fg=black} %change the font color
	%	\setbeamerfont{alerted text}{series=\bfseries} 
		
		\item \textbf{Quantity}: measure resource consumption by household using consumption bundle from CEX 
		\item \textbf{Quality}: proxy share of green goods consumed by Nielsen sustainable panel
		\item[\ar] How high is emission-conusmption by household type? What consumption to target by policy?
		\item[\ar] How do households differ by the share of green goods consume? 
		%\item What household characteristic/ events determine consumption levels?
		\item[\ar] Informs model on how a reduction of emission-consumption can be implemented

\section{The environmental costs of inequality}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}
	
	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
		\setbeamercolor{alerted text}{fg=black} %change the font color
		\setbeamerfont{alerted text}{series=\bfseries} 
		
		\item<+-| alert@+> due to climate change, we need to reduce the consumption of resources
		\vspace{4mm}
		\item<+-| alert@+> a rising willingness to spend for green products implies a \textit{recomposition} of consumption towards less resource-intense goods
		\vspace{4mm}
		\item<+-| alert@+>  but: \textbf{\textcolor{cyan!100}{subjective basic needs}} are high, preventing a demand-driven transition to green production
		\vspace{4mm}
		\item[\ar]<+-| alert@+> How important are subjective basic needs in hampering a transition?  What are the economic consequences of a reduction of subjective basic needs?
	\end{itemize}
	%\textcolor{blue}{insert data on inequality}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Motivation}
	Make model in first project a quantitative model:\\ (1) heterogenous agents to capture distribution of income more accurately;  (2) estimate social responsibility by household and \textbf{subjective} basic needs \ar households do not want to reduce the level of consumption beyond what they perceive as needed (will be a function of income);  (3) introduce carbon cycle to account for dynamics in externality; (4) directed innovation \ar interaction with demand!  \\
	
	\begin{block}{Research Question}
How important an obstacle are subjective basic needs and inequality for a transition to sustainable production?
\end{block}
	\ar empirical research has shown that income determines the level of resource consumption; Empirical work on how income inequality and C02 emissions relate and why; But, income inequality is also a factor that impacts a transition to sustainable production: subjective basic needs are a positive function of income \ar social responsibility will never be effective even if everyone is rich. We need a transition to lower subjective basic needs.
