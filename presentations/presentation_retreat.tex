\begin{frame}{This Paper}
	\vspace{-4mm}
		\begin{block}{Research Question}
			What are the effects of a reduction in consumption on inequality and macro variables?% by consumers? What would policymakers choose?\\ or\\
%What is the socially optimal policy to achieve a sufficient reduction in aggregate consumption?
	\end{block}
\textbf{Model}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item neoclassical growth model: output and consumption determined by factor supply
		\item[\ar] Key to this paper: demand-determined production level allowing for excess supply of labour \\
		\small{building on models of economic slack/ disequilibria, such as }
		
		\item sectors differ with the degree of resource usage % calibrated so that only producing with the low sector does not meet initial consumption levels		
		\item households differ wrt the sector where they are employed \ar unequal effects
		\item with basic needs questionable if reduction in consumption by one type implies reduction in resource usage 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How to model the reduction of consumption?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item deliberate reduction by households; by certain household types
		\item government policy \ar political economy
	\end{itemize}
	Empirical analysis
\begin{itemize}
	\item measure resource consumption by household
	\item What household characteristic/ events determine consumption levels?
	\item[\ar] Informs model on how a reduction of consumption can be implemented
	\item introduce reduction necessary to meet 1.5Â° warming goal
	\item measure 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{The environmental costs of inequality}
\begin{frame}{Motivation}
	Make model in first project a quantitative model:\\ (1) heterogenous agents to capture distribution of income more accurately;  (2) estimate social responsibility by household and \textbf{subjective} basic needs \ar households do not want to reduce the level of consumption beyond what they perceive as needed (will be a function of income);  (3) introduce carbon cycle to account for dynamics in externality; (4) directed innovation \ar interaction with demand!  \\
	
	\begin{block}{Research Question}
How important an obstacle are subjective basic needs and inequality for a transition to sustainable production?
\end{block}
	\ar empirical research has shown that income determines the level of resource consumption; Empirical work on how income inequality and C02 emissions relate and why; But, income inequality is also a factor that impacts a transition to sustainable production: subjective basic needs are a positive function of income \ar social responsibility will never be effective even if everyone is rich. We need a transition to lower subjective basic needs.
