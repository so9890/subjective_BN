\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
\item<+-> two measures to reduce environmental externalities prominent in literature: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item a \alert{\textbf{recomposition}} of production
\item a \textbf{\alert{reduction}} of production (especially: working time reductions)
\end{enumerate}
%(1) a \alert{\textbf{recomposition}} and (2) a \textbf{\alert{reduction}} of production through a working time reduction
\vspace{3mm} 
\item<+-> the two approaches might be complementary, related through general equilibrium effects, and shaped by \textbf{\alert{inequality}}
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-]<+-> reduction policy might be inevitable (e.g., if no perfectly clean technology is available)
\item[-]<+-> but: a reduction in demand and labour supply could affect growth in clean innovations \ar ambiguous effect on externality
\item[-]<+-> even more ambiguous if high-skilled labour supply is specific to the clean sector and affected more
\end{itemize}
\vspace{3mm}
\item<+-> however,  these policies have mainly been studied separately and absent inequality
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\begin{block}{Therefore...}
I want to study recomposition and reduction policies jointly... 
\\
\pause
... by integrating policy instruments to lower the labour supply in a model of directed technical change with  inequality. \\
\vspace{2mm}
\pause
\ar \textbf{What is the optimal policy?}
	\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{This Paper: Model}
	\begin{itemize}
\item model with \textbf{\alert{directed technical change}}  Ã  la \cite{Acemoglu2012TheChange}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item[-] corrective tax, subsidies
%\item[-] clean and dirty sector
%\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\pause
I add 
\begin{itemize}
\item<+-> inequality
\begin{itemize}
\item two household types: \textbf{\alert{high- and low-skilled}}
\item sectors differ in the share of high-skilled labour 
\end{itemize}
\item<+-> \alert{\textbf{working time reduction}} to policy set
\begin{itemize}
\item households face a labour supply decision
\item government can levy distortionary labour and consumption taxes (optimal policy); or an arguably more popular policy: lowering maximum of hours worked
\end{itemize}

\item<+-> %\tr{@Pavel. Potentially not sure about this now}
 \hyperlink{cleanSec}{\textbf{\alert{externality to clean sector}} }
\begin{itemize}
	\item clean technology also requires natural resources
	\item and exerts environmental externalities: in production and as waste
	\item[] \ar working time reduction might become necessary %(depends on regeneration capacity of nature)
\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%\item add inequality, how do things change?

%\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Motivation}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item macroeconomic research on environmental externality generally assumes the existence of a technology that does not exert any externality (using nature as a sink for used products (waste) or during the production process)
%\item[\ar] long-run growth might be sustainable \citep{Acemoglu2012TheChange}
%\item What if there is no such ``clean'' alternative but rather a gradual differentiation between technologies (dirty and less dirty); i.e., a lower bound on technical  innovations to reduce pollution in a way that the regenerative capacity of the planet is not  sufficient to sustain growth
%\item[\ar] growth might have to cease eventually
%\item politically delicate topic
%\item what are the effects on inequality?

\begin{itemize}
\item<+-> on the one hand, proponents of a working time reduction seem not to take interaction with recomposition approaches into account, directed technical change in particular
\item<+-> on the other hand, reduction policies generally not in policy set in endogenous growth models; yet, potentially inevitable when no perfectly clean technology exists
\item<+-> inequality hypothesised to shape interaction of reduction and recomposition policies
\vspace{2mm}
\item[\ar]<+-> What is the optimal policy?
\begin{itemize}
\item<+-> Is a working time reduction optimal when directed technical change and inequality are accounted for?
\item<+-> Is a restriction of working hours politically feasible when taking general equilibrium effects into account?

%\begin{frame}{Why might restrictions on hours worked be chosen as policy?}
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item \cite{Alvarez-Cuadrado2007EnvyHours}
%		The optimal tax policy in a setting with representative agent to restore the efficient allocation is to increase the value of leisure relative to consumption.
%		\item[\ar] a combination of distortionary labour taxation or consumption taxation
%		\item social acceptance of such policies questionable! Consumption becomes either more expensive or more of labour income has to be paid as tax
%		\item[\ar] a restriction on working hours (minimum of vacation days, restrictions on hours worked per week and worker (historic evidence)) might gain a broader social acceptance
%		\item[\ar] political economy approach to see working time reduction being chosen
