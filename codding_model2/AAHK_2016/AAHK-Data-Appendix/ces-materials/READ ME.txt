These materials provide empirical background for the moments and distributions that are 
included in our simulations. 

The central file is programs-ces-consolidated.do, which provides the core programs used
at Center of Economic Studies (CES) to provide the results given in the text. Disclosure 
restrictions only allow us to provide programs, and some parts of these programs are 
redacted due to the firm-level information and identifiers used in the code. The file 
provides greater annotation to guide on this front.

The second file is programs-external-consolidated.do, providing some complementary pieces 
that mainly prepare for the estimations conducted internal to the Census Bureau. The
central output from this work is env-data-prep1c2.dta that consolidates our designations
of clean and dirty energy patents based upon their technology codes.

We are able to provide the env-data-prep1c2.dta file that contains patent records that
form the core of our environment technology sample. This file is used directly at the Census 
Bureau in our analysis. It designates patents connected to clean energy vs. dirty energy. It
also notes the classes designated by Popp and Newell (2012). Patent filing numbers can be 
used to link these records to many external patent sources.
